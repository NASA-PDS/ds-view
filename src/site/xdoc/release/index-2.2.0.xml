      </ul>
    </section>

    <section name="System Requirements">
      <p>This section details the system requirements for installing and operating the software. Specific system requirements for each component in this release can be found in their respective Installation documents.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Java Runtime Environment">
        <p>The custom software contained in this release was developed using Java and will run on any platform with a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The software was specifically developed under Java version 1.6 and has only been tested with this version. The following commands test the local Java installation in a UNIX-based environment:
        </p>

        <source>
% which java
/usr/bin/java

% java -version
java version "1.6.0_26"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03-384-10M3425)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.1-b02-384, mixed mode)
        </source>

        <p>The first command above checks whether the <i>java</i> executable is in the environment's path and the second command reports the version. If Java is not installed or the version is not at least 1.6, Java will need to be downloaded and installed in the current environment. Consult the local system administrator for installation of this software. For the do-it-yourself crowd, the Java software can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/" target="_blank">Oracle Java Download</a> page. The software package of choice is the Java Standard Edition (SE) 6, either the JDK or the JRE package. The JDK package is not necessary to run the software but could be useful if development and compilation of Java software will also occur in the current environment.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Java Application Server">
        <p>The other main system requirement pertains to providing a Java application server for hosting certain components (Registry Service and Registry User Interface). The suggested application server for this release is Apache Tomcat with a minimal version of 6.0.20 through version 7.0.X. Consult the local system administrator for installation of this software. For the do-it-yourself crowd, the Apache Tomcat software can be downloaded from the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Tomcat</a> page. Choose the version to download (6.0 or 7.0) from the menu on the left. Details on downloading, installing and configuring an Apache Tomcat server can be found in the <a href="index-tomcat.html">Tomcat Deployment</a> document.
        </p>
      </subsection>
    </section>

          <li><b>Security Service</b><br/>
            <p>The Security Service provides authentication and authorization functions for the system. This service is satisfied with an open source directory service. The directory service is populated with the PDS personnel list extracted from the PDS3 central catalog database. The application server hosting the Registry Service and Registry User Interface is configured to restrict access to certain URLs and to forward those requests to this service for authentication and authorization.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Discipline Node Environment">
        <p>This section details the deployment to a participating Discipline Node environment. The Nodes are asked to download, install and exercise the software that makes up this release. The following diagram details an example deployment of selected components:
        </p>

        <center>
          <a href="../images/dn-deploy-2.1.0.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DN Deployment" src="../images/dn-deploy-2.1.0-scale.jpg" border="1" /></a><br/>
          Click the image for a larger version.
        </center>

        <p>The selected components depicted above are intended to aid the Nodes in their PDS3 to PDS4 conversion exercises. The following diagram depicts a normalized system flow, starting with schema design, continuing onto data product label generation and validation and finishing up with data product registration:
        </p>

        <center>
          <a href="../images/dn-system-flow-2.1.0.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DN System Flow" src="../images/dn-system-flow-2.1.0-scale.jpg" border="1" /></a><br/>
          Click the image for a larger version.
        </center>

        <p>This diagram identifies where the system components come into play within the system flow. These components and the ones depicted in the deployment diagram, are described in more detail with respect to how the components can be utilized in the PDS3 to PDS4 conversion exercises with an eye towards testing these components for use in operations:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Design Tool</b><br/>
            <p>The Design Tool is intended to aid users in the development of their data product label schemas. This release identifies two off-the-shelf products (Oxygen and Eclipse) that are available for this purpose. The provided documentation guides the user with respect to the download, installation and operation of each of these products.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Generate Tool</b><br/>
            <p>The Generate Tool is intended to aid users in the generation of their data product labels. This tool was developed by the Imaging Node at JPL and provides a command-line interface for generating PDS4 Labels from either a PDS3 Label or a PDS-specific DOM object.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Validate Tool</b><br/>
            <p>The Validate Tool comes pre-packaged with the latest version of the generic schemas generated from the data model. The tool allows the user to validate collections of products or single products against the associated generic schema. Specific schemas can be passed into the tool to enable a more detailed validation check. Although the Design Tools listed above provide a file-by-file validation capability, this tool allows the user to validate a batch of products and generates a summary report.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Harvest Tool</b><br/>
            <p>The Harvest Tool provides the means for registering products with the Registry Service. This tool reads a PDS4 product label, extracts specified metadata and registers the product with the registry. This tool allows the user to register a batch of products and generates a summary report.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Registry Service</b><br/>
            <p>The Registry Service provides functionality for tracking, auditing, locating and maintaining artifacts within the system. Ultimately, all products (including PDS3 products) will be registered and tracked with the Registry Service. For this release, users are asked to install and configure a local instance of the service in order to exercise this procedure. Additionally if the user is participating in the PDS3 to PDS4 conversion exercises, the resulting products or collections of products can be registered with their local registry instance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Registry User Interface</b><br/>
            <p>The Registry User Interface provides a simple viewing capability of the contents of the associated Registry Service. It is intended to offer visual verification of successful registration of products.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Details will be forthcoming regarding deployment of the above components at the Discipline Nodes.
