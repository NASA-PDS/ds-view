    <div class="section"><h2>Installation<a name="Installation"></a></h2>
      <p>This document describes how to install the Inspect Tool contained in the <i>inspect</i> package. The following topics can be found in this document:

      <ul>

    <div class="section"><h2>System Requirements<a name="System_Requirements"></a></h2>
      <p>This section details the system requirements for installing and operating the Inspect Tool software.
      </p>

      <div class="section"><h3>Python<a name="Python"></a></h3>
        <p>The Inspect Tool software was developed using Python and will run on any platform with a supported Python environment. It is compatible with Python 2.6 or 2.7 (Python 2.7.12 is recommended).  It is not compatible with Python 2.5 or earlier versions, nor with Python 3 or later versions.  The following commands test the local Python installation in a UNIX-based environment:
        </p>

        <div class="source"><pre>
% which python
/usr/bin/python

% python --version
Python 2.7.12
        </pre></div>

        <p>The first command above checks whether the <i>python</i> executable is in the environment's path and the second command reports the version. If Python is not installed or the version is not 2.7, Python will need to be downloaded and installed in the current environment. Consult the local system administrator for installation of this software.  If you use 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section"><h3>Python Dependencies<a name="Python_Dependencies"></a></h3>
        <p>The Inspect Tool software has dependencies on a number of Python libraries.  In the future the code will be make into a standalone executable.  For now, those with some Python background can run the Inspect Tool after installing the the following modules:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>pds4_tools</li>
             <p>Module and installation instruction found at <a class="externalLink" href="http://sbndev.astro.umd.edu/wiki/Python_PDS4_Tools">Python PDS4 Tools</a></p>   
          <li>PyQt4 and SIP (PyQt's C++ to Python wrapper code)</li>
             <p>This is the most difficult installation; installation information is found at: <a class="externalLink" href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/installation.html">PyQt4 and SIP instructions.</a> If you get stuck feel free to send an email to &quot;james.e.hofman@jpl.nasa.gov&quot;.</p>
          <li>OrderedDict</li>
          <li>Matplotlib</li>
          <li>Numpy - required by Matplotlib</li>
          <li>python-dateutil - required by Matplotlib</li>
          <li>pytz - required by Matplotlib</li>
          <li>cycler - required by Matplotlib</li>
          <li>pyparsing - required by Matplotlib </li>   
                           
        </ul>
        <p>pip is a package management system used to install and manage python software packages.  It is included in python versions 2.7.9 onward.  It is very easy to use: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/pip/">How to use pip</a>.  It can be used install all of the packages listed above with the exception of PyQt4 and SIP.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2>Unpacking the Package<a name="Unpacking_the_Package"></a></h2>
      <p>Download the <i>inspect</i> package from the PDS <a class="externalLink" href="ftp://pds.nasa.gov/pub/toplevel/2010/preparation/" target="_blank">FTP</a> site. The distribution is available in identical zip or tar/gzip packages. The installation directory may vary from environment to environment but in UNIX-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>/usr/local</i> directory and in Windows-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>C:\Program Files</i> directory. Unpack the selected binary distribution file in the installation directory for the local environment with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      <div class="source"><pre>
% unzip inspect-0.2.0-dev-bin.zip
or
% tar -xzvf inspect-0.2.0-dev-bin.tar.gz
      </pre></div>

      <p>Note: Depending on the platform, the native version of <i>tar</i> may produce an error when attempting to unpack the distribution file because many of the file paths are greater than 100 characters. If available, the GNU version of tar will resolve this problem. If that is not available or cannot be installed, the zipped package will work just fine in a UNIX environment.
      </p>

      <p>The commands above result in the creation of the <i>inspect-0.2.0-dev</i> directory with the following directory structure:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>README.txt</b><br />
          <p>A README file directing the user to the available documentation for the project.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>LICENSE.txt</b><br />
          <p>The copyright notice from the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a> detailing the restrictions regarding the use and distribution of this software. Although the license is strictly worded, the software has been classified as Technology and Software Publicly Available (TSPA) and is available for <i>anyone</i> to download and use.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>bin/</b><br />
          <p>This directory contains Python scripts for launching and interacting with the software for UNIX-based and Windows environments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>doc/</b><br />
          <p>This directory contains a local web site with the Inspect Tool documentation and other configuration management related information. Just point the desired web browser to the <i>index.html</i> file in this directory.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2>Configuring the Environment<a name="Configuring_the_Environment"></a></h2>
      <p>In order to manage and interact with the program-name, the local environment must first be configured appropriately. This section describes how to setup the user environment on UNIX-based and Windows machines.
      </p>

      <div class="section"><h3>UNIX-Based Environment<a name="UNIX-Based_Environment"></a></h3>
        <p>This section details the environment setup for UNIX-based machines. The binary distribution includes a few shell scripts that must be executed from the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the scripts, enables the shell scripts to be executed from any location on the local machine.
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable (in Bourne shell), by appending to its current setting:
        </p>

        <div class="source"><pre>
% export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/inspect-0.2.0-dev/bin
        </pre></div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section"><h3>Windows Environment<a name="Windows_Environment"></a></h3>
        <p>This section details the environment setup for Windows machines. The binary distribution includes a few batch scripts that must be executed from the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the files, enables the batch scripts to be executed from any location on the local machine.
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable, by appending to its current setting:
        </p>

        <div class="source"><pre>
C:\&gt; set PATH = %PATH%;C:\Program Files\inspect-0.2.0-dev\bin
        </pre></div>

        <p>Additional methods for setting Windows environment variables can be found in the <a href="index-win.html">Windows System Properties</a> document.
