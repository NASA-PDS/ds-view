      <subsection name="Command-Line Options">
        <p>The following table describes the command-line options available:
        </p>

        <source>
 -b,--base-path &lt;base path mask&gt;     Specify the base file path mask to be
                                     stripped from the input file path to allow
                                     output in a relative directory structure.
                                     Requires -o flag to also be specified.
 -d,--debug                          Verbose debugging output. Shows each step
                                     of parsing and label generation.
 -h,--help                           Display usage.
 -o,--output-path &lt;output path&gt;      Specify an output path to output the new
                                     PDS4 labels. By default, the file will
                                     output in same location as the input file.
 -p,--pds3-label &lt;pds3 label&gt;        Parse the file or list of files as PDS3
                                     Standard labels (also applicable for VICAR
                                     labels).
 -t,--template &lt;velocity template&gt;   Specify the file path for the Velocity
                                     template used to convert of the
 -V,--version                        Display application version.

      <subsection name="Execute Generate Tool">
        <p>This section demonstrates execution of the tool using the command-line options. The examples below execute the tool via the batch/shell script.
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to run the Generate Tool to convert from a PDS3 Label to a PDS4 Label using a Velocity template file and output to a file:
        </p>

        <source>
% generate -p &lt;pds3-label-path&gt; -t &lt;velocity-template-path&gt;
        </source>

        <p>The output would go into a file &lt;pds3-label-path&gt;.xml (i.e. $HOME/mpf123.img -&gt; $HOME/mpf123.xml
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to run the Generate Tool to convert from a PDS3 Label to a PDS4 Label using a Velocity template file and output all debug information to standard out:
        </p>

        <source>
% generate -d -p &lt;pds3-label-path&gt; -t &lt;velocity-template-path&gt;
        </source>
