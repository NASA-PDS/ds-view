        Update PDS3 label readers and velocity functions to handle image input streams and TASK objects for the Transcoder.

      <action dev="jpadams" type="update" issue="PDS-379">
        Add new updated MPF template to go along with model version 1400. Create new pds_velocity_macros.xml that contains several Velocity Macros that can perform some functions common to label conversion from PDS3. update test accordingly so I could try out the new template.
      </action>
      <action dev="jpadams" type="update" issue="PDS-380">
        Update PDS3 label flag to allow multiple input files. Create new base-path flag to allow user to provide a basepath to remove from the input files path. Allows for relative path to be added to a specified output-path. Update test to include multiple label generation.
      </action>
      <action dev="jpadams" type="update" issue="PDS-384">
        Upgrade to vicario 4.0. add test to make sure any future upgrades can read the labels. Add new label as a test because it contains special characters. Update expected test output to reflect the cleaner output that comes from the transcoder.

      <action dev="jpadams" type="update" issue="PDS-318">
        Update ItemNode to extend ArrayList because it should have been that from the start. Now this object is iterable and has all of the methods that come with an ArrayList. Updated Generator to build the output directory path if it doesn't exist. Update example template to no longer use getRecords and instead iterate through a counter and use some of the ArrayList methods from ItemNote.
