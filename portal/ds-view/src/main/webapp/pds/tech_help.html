			<font face="verdana" size="4"><b>Data Set Search - there are three levels of search capability:</b></font><br><br>
			<font face="verdana" size="2">
			<ul><li><b>MARS Data Set Quick Search</b> - an entry level search capability which allows 
    the user to pick one or more values from a single attribute of the data 
    (e.g., the user can select 'Mariner69' and 'Mariner71' from the list of 
    Missions).  This interface purposely constrains the user to only selecting
    from a single attribute (e.g., Mission, Target, Instrument, etc).
			<li><b>MARS Data Set Advanced Search</b> - a more advanced search capability which provides
    the user with more attributes against which to query for data.  Also, this
    interface does not constrain queries to a single attribute (e.g., the user
    can select 'Mariner69' and 'Mariner71' from the list of Missions, can 
    select 'Mars' as the Target, and 'Planet' as the Target Type).
			<li><b>MARS Data Set Power Search</b> - the most advanced and powerful search capability 
    of the three search capabilities.  This interface was designed for the 
    sophisticated user (e.g., users who are extremely familiar with the individual
    and collective attributes associated with the data of interest).  This 
    interface provides the widest degree of selecting attributes against which
    to query the data.</ul>

			<ul><li><b>Data Set</b> - the individual names of the data sets that match the query.
   			<li><b>Instrument Host</b> - the individual names of the instrument host (spacecraft)
    that match the query.
    		<li><b>Information About the Data Set (View Information)</b> - by clicking on the 
    respective link, the PDS label will be displayed for the data product.
    		<li><b>Data Products and Related Files (Product Search)</b> - by clicking on the 
    respective link, a "default" browser will be displayed which allows
    the user to further constrain which data products are available for
    download.  The "default" browser page is the entry point to where the user selects 
    one more more files for downloading to the users local machine.  The 
    basic set of information contains:
    
      <ul><li><b>Product</b> - the list of all data products matching the query
      <li><b>Information (View Label)</b> - clicking on the link will display the PDS 
          label for the data product.
      <li><b>Download (Get Product)</b> - clicking on the link will cause the web browser
        to display a "save file" dialog box.  This is the mechanism for saving
        files to the user's machine.</ul>
	<li><b>Other Resources</b> - this column displays the set of PDS resources that are
    available for accessing the data set.  These tools provide additional 
    information or are relevant to processing / accessing the data.</ul>

Questions and Answers:
</b></font>

<ol>
<font face="verdana" size="2"><li><b><a name="pds">What is the PDS?</a></b>
<p>
PDS stands for the Planetary Data System. The 
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/">PDS</a> is a NASA-sponsored
organization that archives and distributes high-qality planetary
data to the science community.
<p>
<a href="#toc">Back to List</a></p>
</li>

<li><b><a name="pdsd">What is PDS-D?</a></b>
<p>
PDS-D stands for the PDS Distribution System. It is a web-based
system that enables science users to find and retrieve PDS data.
PDS-D is a new system, which has only been online since October 1,
2002. It is currently under active development.
<p>
<a href="#toc">Back to List</a></p>
</li>

<li><b><a name="users">Do I need to be a scientist to use the system?</a></b>
<p>
No, but it helps. :) The system was designed for the science user, 
and much of the data are &quot;low level&quot;, and require quite 
a bit of background knowledge to understand. If you are mainly
interested in the pictures taken by various NASA missions, you are
encouraged to visit the <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/">
Planetary Photo Journal</a>. 
<p>
<a href="#toc">Back to List</a></p>
</li>


<li><b><a name="software">Do I need any special software?</a></b>
<p>
Finding and downloading data through PDS-D requires only a recent 
version of a web browser, such as Internet Explorer or Netscape. If 
you plan to use the map interface to select data from the Planetary 
Atlas (a component of the system), you will need to install a Java 2
plug-in. For further information, see the Planetary Atlas
<a href="http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/AtlasHelp/MapReq.html">requirements</a>
page.<br><br>

Once the data are obtained, a variety of tools may be used for 
viewing and analysis. Almost all PDS data are viewable with NASAView,
a free program that can be 
<a href="http://pdsproto.jpl.nasa.gov/Distribution/license.html">
downloaded</a> from this site.
<p>
<a href="#toc">Back to List</a></p>
</li>

<li><b><a name="data">What data are available?</a></b>
<p>
The initial version of PDS-D is focused on Mars data, and Odyssey in
particular. As the system matures, it will provide access to data from
other new missions and from the entire PDS archive.
<p>
<a href="#toc">Back to List</a></p>
</li>

<li><b><a name="find">How do I find the data?</a></b>
<p>
The most common strategy is to perform a two-step search. In the 
first step, you narrow the search to one or more data sets of
interest. In the second step, you search for products in those
data sets. The place to start is the 
<a href="http://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/pds/index.jsp">data set search</a>
page.
<p>
<a href="#toc">Back to List</a></p>
</li>

<li><b><a name="get">How do I get the data?</a></b>
<p>
When your search returns a list of products, you can select the ones
you wish to download.
<p>
<a href="#toc">Back to List</a></p>
</li>

<li><b><a name="download">How much data can I download?</a></b>
<p>
One of the ideas behind PDS-D is that the science user can hone in on
the data products of interest and not need to download an entire data
set, which can be very large (THEMIS is expected to grow to around 6 
terabytes. If your download requirements exceed 500 megabytes, it is 
suggested that you contact the <a href="mailto:pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov">
PDS_Operator</a>.
