     A HISTORY object is a dynamic description of the history of
     one or more associated data objects in a file.  It
     supplements the essentially static description contained in
     the PDS label.
     The HISTORY object contains text in a
     format similar to that of the ODL statements used in the
     label.  It identifies previous computer manipulation of 
     the principal data object(s) in the file.  It includes an
     identification of the source data, processes performed,
     processing parameters, as well as dates and times of
     processing.  It is intended that the history be available
     for display, be dynamically extended by any process
     operating on the data, and automatically propagated to the
     resulting data file.  Eventually, it might be extracted for
     loading in detailed level catalogs of data set contents.
     The HISTORY object is structured as a series of History
     Entries, one for each process which has operated on the
     data.  Each entry contains a standard set of 
  ODL element
     assignment statements, delimited by GROUP = program_name
     and END_GROUP = program_name statements.  A subgroup in
     each entry, delimited by GROUP = PARAMETERS and END_GROUP =
     PARAMETERS, contains statements specifying the values of
     all parameters of the program.
     HISTORY ENTRY ELEMENTS
     Attribute       Description
     VERSION_DATE    Program version date, ISO standard format.
     DATE_TIME       Run date and time, ISO standard format.
     NODE_NAME       Network name of computer
     USER_NAME       Username.
     SOFTWARE_DESC   Program-generated (brief) description.
     USER_NOTE       User-supplied (brief) description.
     Unlike the above
     elements, the names of the parameters defined in the
     PARAMETERS subgroup are uncontrolled, and must only conform
     to the program.
     The last entry in a HISTORY object is
     followed by an END statement.  The HISTORY object, by
     convention, follows the PDS label of the file, beginning on
     a record boundary, and is located by a pointer statement in
     the label. There are no required elements for the PDS label
     description of the object; it is represented in the label
     only by the pointer statement, and OBJECT = HISTORY and
     END_OBJECT = HISTORY statements.
     The HISTORY capability
     has been implemented as part of the Integrated Software for
     Imaging Spectrometers (ISIS) system (see QUBE object
     definition).  ISIS Qube applications add their own entries
     to the Qube file's cumulative History object.  ISIS
     programs run under NASA's TAE (Transportable Applications
     Executive) system, and are able to automatically insert all
     parameters of their TAE procedure into the history entry
     created by the program.  Consult the ISIS System Design
     document for details and limitations imposed by that
     system.  (See the QUBE object description for further
     references.)"
