    DESCRIPTION   = "The position match score is a parameter correlated       
      with the difference between the predicted and observed positions        
      of the asteroid. It is the cross-covariance of the two position         
      probability density functions (for the observed and computed asteroid   
      positions) evaluated at the observed separation and assuming a single   
      one-sigma positional uncertainty of 10 arc-seconds for the computed     
      positions (see Tedesco, et al. 1992 [TEDESCOETAL1992], p. 137).         
      Acceptance required a result  to be above 1000 (the density functions   
      had units of probability mass per steradian). The units employed in     
      the position probability density functions resulted in the figure of    
      merit having a large value (1000 up to as much as one billion). The     
      corresponding figure of merit used subsequently was obtained by         
      taking  the common logarithm of the cross-covariance figure of merit,   
      subtracting three, and dividing by 6. This resulted in a number         
      between zero and one  (Matson, 1986 [MATSON1986], p. 6-16).
