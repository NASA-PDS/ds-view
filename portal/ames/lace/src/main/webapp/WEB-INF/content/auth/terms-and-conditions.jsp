<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
</div>

<div id="content">
<p>LACE is a web application
hosted in the USA where users are allowed to create and import
metadata documents describing spaceflight data and investigations.
Users are responsible for knowing their rights to create and
distribute such content both in their location and in the USA, and for
ensuring the appropriateness of information they upload to LACE. Users
should not enter or upload any information considered: Classified;
Sensitive, but Unclassified; Official Use Only; Copyrighted (without
retaining proper copyright notices and without obtaining permission
where not the owner); ITAR restricted; Proprietary (without permission
where not the owner); Obscene; or containing other inappropriate
comments, including use of foul language or derogatory remarks. See
below for more information concerning these types of inappropriate
content. Advertisements for products or services or other content
intended for commercial marketing purposes are also inappropriate.</p>

<p>The DASHLink collaborative website is designed for research
purposes only, and thus any mention of a product or service should be
pertinent to a specific research activity and be presented in a
research context. We reserve the right to remove any content we deem
to be advertising in nature.</p>

<h1>ITAR, Export Controlled, and Proprietary<br />or Copyrighted
Information</h1>

<p>This website is not for the transfer or storage of classified,
sensitive or proprietary information; therefore, classified,
Sensitive, But Unclassified/Official Use Only, or other sensitive or
proprietary information (such as inventions or other forms of
intellectual property) may not be processed, entered or stored on the
collaboration websites. Information is considered &#x201C;classified&#x201D; if it
contains national security information, which requires proper handling
and safeguarding under national security laws and regulations.
Information is considered &#x201C;proprietary&#x201D; where such information was
developed at private expense and embodies trade secrets or contains
commercial or financial information over which the owner intends to
control access and use. Users must have explicit written approval from
the owner before removing the proprietary status of proprietary
information and before such information is uploaded onto the
website.</p>

<h1>Consequences for Inappropriate<br />and Illegal Behavior</h1>

<p>Users who post illegal material or who use this website for illegal
activities will lose access to their account and will be reported to
the appropriate authorities. Users who post inappropriate or otherwise
defamatory or obscene content may receive only a one-time warning for
the first such posting. Should the transgression occur again, the User
would lose access to their account and any privilege to approve an
account. Users who post information that violate sensitive, but
unclassified/official use only requirements, copyright or proprietary
rights will be warned and their Civil Servant sponsor (for Civil
Servants, their immediate supervisor) will be notified. Upon a
case-by-case review, such users could potentially lose access.</p>

<p>Users who are removed from the site and wish to reapply for access
will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and must be reauthorized
through their Civil Servant contact. Should the User be a Civil
Servant, they will require authorization through their supervisor. It
will be incumbent on the authorizing person to indicate whether a user
should be reaccepted although the authorizing person will not be held
accountable for the Users actions. Should the User transgress again,
they will be removed permanently with no recourse to reapply. The
User's organization may choose to take further action regarding the
behavior of its User employees. Upon written request, the website
administrator will cooperate by providing user names and
timestamps.</p>

<h1>Deactivation of Accounts</h1>

<p>Should a user at any time wish to deactivate their account they
should <a href="mailto:rich.keller@nasa.gov">send email</a> requesting
that their data stored on the LACE server be deleted.

<h1>Registration for Accounts</h1>

<p>To become a registered user, you must in some way be affiliated
with the NASA scientific community. Please
<s:a action="register">register</s:a> to request access to LACE.</p>
