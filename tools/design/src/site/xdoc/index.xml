    <section name="About Design Tool">
      <p>The Design Tool provides functionality for designing product label schemas using the XML Schema standard. Although a PDS-specific tool may be developed in the future, Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Open Source tools have been identified to satisfy this functional need. Along with facilitating manipulation of a generic schema into a specific schema, the tool also generates sample product labels to aide users in schema comprehension.
