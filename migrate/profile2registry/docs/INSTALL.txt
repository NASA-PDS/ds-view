Requirements
============

This package has no external requirements (aside from Python >=2.4 <3.0).


Installation
============

By far, the easiest way to install this is to use pip_ or easy_install_.  As a
privileged user, type::

    pip install pds.profile2registry

or::

    easy_install pds.profile2registry

The software as well as its dependencies will be downloaded and installed
automatically.

Are you an advanced user who takes advantage of virtualenv_ or buildout_?  You
know what to do.


Installing from Source
----------------------

If neither pip nor easy_install are available on your system, just install
from source:

1.  Download the source package archive.
2.  Extract the gzip'd tar archive.
3.  In the extracted directory, run ``python setup.py install`` as a
    privileged user.
