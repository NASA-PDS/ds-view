        This is a converter of sorts.  It takes PDS_ information in OODT_ profile
        servers, translates them as needed, and loads them into a PDS `Registry
        Service`_.
        
        Nifty, huh?

        Requirements
        ============
        
        This package has no external requirements (aside from Python >=2.4 <3.0).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        By far, the easiest way to install this is to use pip_ or easy_install_.  As a
        privileged user, type::
        
            pip install pds.profile2registry
        
        or::
        
            easy_install pds.profile2registry
        
        The software as well as its dependencies will be downloaded and installed
        automatically.
        
        Are you an advanced user who takes advantage of virtualenv_ or buildout_?  You
        know what to do.
        
        
        Installing from Source
        ----------------------
        
        If neither pip nor easy_install are available on your system, just install
        from source:
        
        1.  Download the source package archive.
        2.  Extract the gzip'd tar archive.
        3.  In the extracted directory, run ``python setup.py install`` as a
            privileged user.
