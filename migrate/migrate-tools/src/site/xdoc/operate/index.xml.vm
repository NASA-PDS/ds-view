    <section name="ADS Loader">
      <p>This software migrates the content from the Profile Server supporting references from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) to a Registry Service. The software that queries for this content is contained in the Data Set View component. This software does have a dependency on the <i>profile2Registry</i> package which must be deployed to the local Python environment prior to operation of this software. The ADS Loader software consists of two Python scripts:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>ads-cleaner.py<br/>This script removes the duplicate entries from the sorted <i>identifiers-sort.txt</i> input file. The input files can be found in the <i>resources</i> directory. The output from the this script is contained in the <i>identifiers-sort-clean.txt</i> file.
        </li>
        <li>ads-loader.py<br/>This script takes the cleaned input file, <i>identifiers-sort-clean.txt</i>, and queries the Profile Server for each entry and ingests those entries with the Registry Service.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The scripts referenced above can be found in the <i>bin/ads-loader</i> directory.
