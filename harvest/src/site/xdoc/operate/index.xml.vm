    <section name="Tool Setup">
      <p>In order to execute Harvest Tool, the user's environment must first be configured appropriately. This section describes how to setup the user environment on UNIX-based and Windows machines.
      </p>

      <subsection name="UNIX-Based Setup">
        <p>This section details the environment setup for UNIX-based machines. The preferred method is to specify the shell script, <i>Harvest</i>, on the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the script, enables the shell script to be executed from any location on the user's machine.
        </p>
        
        <p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable, by appending to its current setting: 
        </p>
        
        <source>
% setenv PATH ${PATH}:$HOME/${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}/bin
        </source>        
        
        <p>The tool can now be executed via the shell script as demonstrated in the following example:
        </p>
        
        <source>
% Harvest &lt;command-line arguments&gt;
        </source>

        <p>Additional methods for setting up a UNIX-based environment can be found in the <a href="index-unix.html">UNIX Setup Options</a> section. If viewing this document in PDF form, see the appendix for details.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Windows Setup">
        <p>This section details the environment setup for Windows machines. The preferred method is to specify the batch file, <i>Harvest.bat</i>, on the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the file, enables the batch file to be executed from any location on the user's machine.
        </p>
        
        <p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable, by appending to its current setting:
        </p>
        
        <source>
C:\&gt; set PATH = %PATH%;C:\\${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}\bin
        </source>       
        
        <p>The tool can now be executed via the batch file as demonstrated in the following example:
        </p>
        
        <source>
C:\&gt; Harvest &lt;command-line arguments&gt;
        </source>

        <p>Additional methods for setting up a Windows environment can be found in the <a href="index-win.html">Windows Setup Options</a> section. If viewing this document in PDF form, see the appendix for details.
