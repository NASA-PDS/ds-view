    <section name="Tool Setup">
      <p>In order to execute Harvest Tool, the user's environment must first be configured appropriately. This section describes how to setup the user environment on UNIX-based and Windows machines.
      </p>

      <subsection name="UNIX-Based Setup">
        <p>This section details the environment setup for UNIX-based machines. The preferred method is to specify the shell script, <i>Harvest</i>, on the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the script, enables the shell script to be executed from any location on the user's machine.
        </p>
        
        <p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable, by appending to its current setting: 
        </p>
        
        <source>
% setenv PATH ${PATH}:$HOME/${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}/bin
        </source>        
        
        <p>The tool can now be executed via the shell script as demonstrated in the following example:
        </p>
        
        <source>
% Harvest &lt;policy file&gt; &lt;command-line arguments&gt;
        </source>

        <p>Additional methods for setting up a UNIX-based environment can be found in the <a href="index-unix.html">UNIX Setup Options</a> section. If viewing this document in PDF form, see the appendix for details.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Windows Setup">
        <p>This section details the environment setup for Windows machines. The preferred method is to specify the batch file, <i>Harvest.bat</i>, on the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the file, enables the batch file to be executed from any location on the user's machine.
        </p>
        
        <p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable, by appending to its current setting:
        </p>
        
        <source>
C:\&gt; set PATH = %PATH%;C:\\${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}\bin
        </source>       
        
        <p>The tool can now be executed via the batch file as demonstrated in the following example:
        </p>
        
        <source>
C:\&gt; Harvest &lt;policy file&gt; &lt;command-line arguments&gt;
        </source>

        <p>Additional methods for setting up a Windows environment can be found in the <a href="index-win.html">Windows Setup Options</a> section. If viewing this document in PDF form, see the appendix for details.
        </p>
      </subsection>
    </section>

    <section name="Tool Execution">
      <p>Harvest Tool can be executed in various ways. This section describes how to run the tool, as well as its behaviors and caveats.
      </p>
      
      <subsection name="Command-Line Options">
        <p>The following table describes the command-line options available:
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr><th>Command-Line Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr><td>-u, --username</td><td>Specify a username for authentication with the PDS Security Service.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-p, --password</td><td>Specify a password associated with the username.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-l, --log-file</td><td>Specify a log file name. Default is standard out.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-V, --version</td><td>Display the release number and copyright information.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-h, --help</td><td>Display Harvest usage.</td></tr>
        </table>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Execute Harvest Tool">
        <p>This section demonstrates execution of the tool using the command-line options. The examples below execute the tool via the batch/shell script. Alternate methods for executing the tool can be found in the <a href="#Tool_Setup">Tool Setup</a> section.
        </p>
        
        <p>The Harvest Tool operates with a policy file to register product metadata. Details on how to create this policy file can be found in the <a href="#Harvest Policy File">Harvest Policy File</a> section.
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to run the Harvest Tool against a policy file, <i>policy.xml</i>, using a valid username, <i>pds</i>, and password, <i>mypwd</i>, with the output going to standard out:
        </p>
        
        <source>
% Harvest policy.xml -u pds -p mypwd
        </source>
        
        <p>The following command demonstrates how to run the Harvest Tool with the output going to a log file, <i>log.txt</i> instead of standard out:
        </p>
        
        <source>
% Harvest policy.xml -u pds -p mypwd -l log.txt
        </source>   
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Harvest Policy File">
        <p>The Harvest policy file is an XML file that the tool uses to find products and register its metadata.
        </p>
        
        <p>The following is the schema for the policy file:    
      </subsection>
    </section>

    <section name="Report Format">
      <p>This section describes the contents of the Harvest Tool report.
      </p>
      
      <p>At this time, the Harvest Tool only outputs a series of log messages. The log will report the success or failure of a discovered product attempting to be registered. Additionally, any syntactical errors in a discovered product are reported.
      </p>
      
      <p>A log consists of a severity level, file name, and a message. The following is an example of some of the log messages that can be expected from the Harvest Tool:
