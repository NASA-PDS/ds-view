      <p>When Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications have been configured for access control, the user is redirected to the following OpenAM login screen to provide their identification credentials:
      </p>

      <center>
        <a href="../images/openam-login-screen.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="OpenAM Login" src="../images/openam-login-screen-scale.jpg" border="1" /></a><br/>

      </center>

      <p>Once the user enters their identification credentials (user name and password) correctly, they are redirected back to the original application. If the user is accessing an access controlled application via its REST-based interface, they can utilize the <i>curl</i> application to obtain an authentication cookie as follows:
      </p>

      <source>
% curl -d "&amp;username=&lt;username&gt;&amp;password=&lt;password&gt;" \
http://pdsops.jpl.nasa.gov/openam/identity/authenticate

token.id=AQIC5wM2LY4SfcyFAElnVTJ4ywAONCJRVy74LMgzFYbRmdI=@AAJTSQACMDE=#
      </source>

      <p>This cookie can then be passed as follows in a POST request:
      </p>

      <source>
% curl -X POST ... --cookie 'iPlanetDirectoryPro="&lt;token.id&gt;"'
      </source>
