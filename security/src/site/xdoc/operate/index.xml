      <p>When Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications have been configured for access control, the following login screen will be displayed to provide their identification credentials:
      </p>

      <center>
        <img src="../images/tomcat_opends_login_screen.jpg" target="_blank"/>
      </center>

      <p>Once the user enters their identification credentials (user name and password) correctly, you can access to the original application.</p>
      <p>Also, you can utilize the <i>curl</i> commmand to an access controlled application. An example of the command is as follows:
      </p>

      <source>
% curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/xml" -d @./new_product_build0.xml \
-v https://pdsdev.jpl.nasa.gov:8443/registry-service/registry/products -u username:password \
-k -c tomcat_cookie.txt
      </source>

      <p>The cookie file (tomcat_cookie.txt) can then be passed to next curl commands. 
      </p>

      <source>
% curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/xml" -d @./new_product_build1.xml \
-v https://pdsdev.jpl.nasa.gov:8443/registry-service/registry/products/1234 -k -b tomcat_cookie.txt
      </source>

      <p>The example above also applies to a <i>DELETE</i> request.
