    <section name="Operation">
      <p>When Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications have been configured for access control, the following login screen is displayed for users to provide their identification credentials:
      </p>

      <center>
        <img alt="OpenDS Login Screen" src="../images/tomcat_opends_login_screen.jpg" border="1"/>
      </center>

      <p>Once the user enters their identification credentials (user name and password) correctly, you can access to the requestd application. Also, you can utilize the <i>curl</i> command to access a controlled application. An example of the command is as follows:
      </p>

      <source>
% curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/xml" -d @./new_product_build0.xml \
-v https://localhost:8443/registry-service/registry/extrinsics -u username:password \
-k -c tomcat_cookie.txt
      </source>

      <p>The cookie file <i>tomcat_cookie.txt</i> can then be passed to the next <i>curl</i> command: 
      </p>

      <source>
% curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/xml" -d @./new_product_build1.xml \
-v https://localhost:8443/registry-service/registry/extrinsics/1234 -k -b tomcat_cookie.txt
      </source>

      <p>The example above also applies to a <i>DELETE</i> request.
