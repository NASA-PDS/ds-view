The Security Service is satisfied with the Open Source software OpenDS. 
This project contains the web site containing the documentation for 
installing and configuring the open source software for the PDS4 system.

The documentation including release notes, installation and operation of 
the software should be online at http://pds-cm.jpl.nasa.gov/pds4/security/. 
If it is not accessible, you can execute the "mvn site:run" command and 
view the documentation locally at http://localhost:8080.

In order to create the site and deploy it, execute the following commands: 

% mvn site-deploy
