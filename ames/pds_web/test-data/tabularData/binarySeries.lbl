      of the series could map to the following floating point value:

All waveform data files are binary and have a fixed record length             
structure. The first record is an ASCII header (padded to record              
length) that contains many of the same parameters contained in                
this label file. The next record is a binary header that also                 
contains much of the same information as this label. This label               
is derived from the data file by reading these headers. The binary            
header record is described in machine readable form by the PDS label          
file EDRHDR.FMT and in a more human readable for in EDRHDR.TXT.               
                                                                              
The remaining records contain data. Each data record has a 30 byte            
header (prefix) followed by n (n=1 or 10) blocks of waveform samples.         
In most cases, only a few of these data blocks contain data (the rest         
may be zero filled). The file record length, the number of waveform           
samples per data block, and the sampling frequency are dependent on           
the spacecraft telemetry mode and the instrument mode. The following          
table describes the variations in waveform data files:

Each data record contains data acquired in a single minor frame               
(mod91=0.667 seconds). The time tag for the data record is located            
in the row prefix header (ROWPRFX.FMT).  The start time of a block            
of waveform samples is the RTI in which the data block occurs                 
(10 RTI per minor frame, 0-9). Therefore if the waveform samples              
are located in data block 3 and the row prefix header gives the               
time tag 03209117:27:0:0, then the samples begin at 03209117:27:2:0.          
The time between samples is determined by the sampling frequency.             
There are 3150, 25200, 201600 samples per second in the 1 kHz, 10 kHz,        
and 80 kHz modes respectivley. Please note that in the PWH5 mode,             
there are more samples than can be taken in a single RTI at the               
1 kHz sample rate. The waveform data are sampled uniformly and                
continuously in a single data block, across the RTI boundaries.               
These data are non-overlapping so that data cannot occur in all               
of the data blocks for this mode/format combination."
