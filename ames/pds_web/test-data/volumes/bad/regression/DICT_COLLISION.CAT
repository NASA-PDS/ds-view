            The software used to process the data from the IDFS form  
            to the PDS-compliant form is included for archival.       
            Also, the software to generate the Geometry and Position  
            index table and label files from the data labels and      
            SPICE kernels is included. The input files for this       
            software are not for archival, so they are found in the   
            EXTRAS directory. There are two programs:                 
                                                                      
            1. IDFStoPDS - Software tool to process IDFS data to the  
               PDS-compliant spreadsheet form (CSV) and generate      
               associated PDS labels (LBL), written by SwRI.          
                                                                      
            2. GeoTab - Software tool to read SPICE kernels and       
               generate the geometry table and associated label,      
               written by PSA team, customized by SwRI. GeoTab must   
               parse the data labels for creating the geometry index  
               table, so SwRI added functionality to GeoTab to also   
               replace keyword values (start with '$' to indicate     
               placeholder) in the data labels.
