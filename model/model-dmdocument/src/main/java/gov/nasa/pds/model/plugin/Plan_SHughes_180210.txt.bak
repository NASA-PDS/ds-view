1) Review - GPO application for 16363 audit

   BA - I have spent the past few hours reviewing the GPO application for 16363
   audit.  A few items stand out so far.

  Another item that interests me is the designation of the offsite iteration of
  fedsys as the primary preservation site and the onsite iteration as the backup
  site.  A rather unusual game plan that deserves explanation, examination and
  description in the final report.

	1. I think we can get a good idea of the type of stand alone report that GPO
	would like to be able to distribute  to their designated communities by
	looking at the 2012 NAPA report listed:

	https://www.gpo.gov/docs/default-source/congressional-relations-pdf-
	files/gpo_napa_report_final.pdf.

	While that report focused on expanding the role of GPO in digital information
	preservation, we can look to the format, language, and recommendations as a
	partial template.to create a document for their designated communties.

  Good find. I think when we see Jessica’s self review, that may be a good indicator too.

 

	2.  Their division of their designated communities into primary and secondary
	categories needs some examination.and explanation.

  I also noted the division of having the Designated Communities that they were
  preserving for and then the additional users/consumers that they also have to
  serve. 
  
  	I think that is pretty reasonable way to divvy it up.


	3. I think we also need to look at the cited NARA"audit" and affiliated
	archives agreement and at the NIST Security Assessment Report.

     Yes, will be interesting to see these.
