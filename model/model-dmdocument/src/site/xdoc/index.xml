      <p>This component is a Maven plugin that takes output from <a href='http://protege.stanford.edu/'>Protégé</a>
        in the form of ontology instance files and from that generates DM-documents and other artifacts
        that can be used to do report, chronicle, detail, and describe the PDS ontology in a number
        of formats.
      </p>
      <p>To use this component, you reference it from a Maven project that has ontology files and a <code>pom.xml</code>
        configured with a <code>build</code> section to execute the plugin on the ontology files.  Typically, you
        will install your ontology files in <code>PROJECT-BASEDIR/src/ontology/Data</code>.  Then, add the following
        <code>build</code> section to <code>pom.xml</code>:

      <p>The above tells Maven to use the plugin called "pds-model-dmdocument-maven-plugin" version "1.6.0-dev",
        produced by the group "gov.nasa.pds.2010".  Maven should use this plugin during the <code>compile</code> phase
        of software generation.  During the compile phase, we ask the plugin to create documentation files
        (with the <code>generateDocumentation</code> goal), to generate class files
        (with the <code>generateClasses</code> goal),
        and generate attribute definitions (with the <code>generateAttributes</code> goal).  The results will go into
        the project's JAR file (assuming the POM's packaging is set to <code>jar</code>).
      </p>
      <p>To generate these artifacts, you can then run <code>mvn jar:jar</code>.  The artifacts will be generated and
        bundled up into the project's <code>.jar</code> file in the <code>target</code> subdirectory.
      </p>
