    <section name="About LDDTool">
      <p>The PDS4 Local Data Dictionary Tool (LDDTool) parses a local data dictionary definition file and generates PDS4 data standard files. A local data dictionary at the discipline level is required to be ingested. A dictionary at the mission level can optionally be ingested. These new dictionaries augment the common model and have their own stewards and unique namespaces. The audience includes personnel at PDS discipline and data nodes, principal investigators and their staffs, and ground data system engineers. The tool will be most useful to people who have prior experience with the PDS Information Model and modeling practices.
