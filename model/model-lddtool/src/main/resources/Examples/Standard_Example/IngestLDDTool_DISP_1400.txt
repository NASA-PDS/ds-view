   description            The horizontal_display_axis attribute identifies, by name, the axis of an Array (or Array subclass) that is intended to be displayed in the horizontal or "sample" dimension on a display device. The value of this attribute must match the value of one, and only one, axis_name attribute in an Axis_Array class of the associated Array.

   name                   horizontal_display_direction
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed

   permissible value - value meaning
      Left to Right - The lowest indexed element along an array axis should be displayed at the left edge of a display device and elements with higher indices should be displayed further to the right. Note that this is the standard display direction for most major image formats.
      Right to Left - The lowest indexed element along an array axis should be displayed at the right edge of a display device and elements with higher indices should be displayed further to the left. Note that virtually no image display formats use this display direction. Use this only when deliberately mirroring the image around the vertical axis.

   name                   vertical_display_direction
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The vertical_display_direction attribute specifies the direction along the screen of a display device that data along the vertical axis of an Array is supposed to be displayed.
   minimum characters     13
   maximum characters     13
   permissible value - value meaning

      Bottom to Top - The lowest indexed element along an array axis should be displayed at the bottom edge of a display device and elements with higher indices should be displayed higher up. This is the display direction typically used for FITS formatted data.

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The color_display_axis attribute identifies, by name, the axis of an Array (or Array subclass) that is intended to be displayed in the color dimension of a display device. I.e., bands from this dimension will be loaded into the red, green, and blue bands of the display device. The value of this attribute must match the value of one, and only one, axis_name attribute in an Axis_Array class of the associated Array.

   name                   red_channel_band

   description            The green_channel_band attribute identifies the number of the band, along the band axis, that should be loaded, by default, into the green channel of a display device. The first band along the band axis has band number 1.
   minimum value          1

   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description            The blue_channel_band attribute identifies the number of the band, along the band axis, that should be loaded, by default, into the blue channel of a display device. The first band along the band axis has band number 1.

   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The frame_rate attribute indicates the number of still pictures (or frames) that should be displayed per unit of time in a video. Note this is NOT necessarily the same as the rate at which the images were acquired.
   minimum value          1.0
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Frame_Rate

   name                   loop_flag
   version                1.5

   description            The loop_flag attribute specifies whether or not a movie object should be played repeatedly without prompting from the user.
   permissible value - value meaning
      true - The movie should be "looped" or played repeatedly.
      false - The movie should be not be "looped" or played repeatedly.

   name                   loop_count
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description            The loop_count attribute specifies the number of times a movie should be "looped" or replayed before stopping.
   minimum value          1

   name                   loop_delay
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The loop_delay attribute specifies the amount of time to pause between "loops" or repeated playbacks of a movie.
   minimum value          0.0
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Time

   name                   loop_back_and_forth_flag
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Boolean
   description            The loop_back_and_forth_flag attribute specifies whether or not a movie should only be "looped" or played repeatedly in the forward direction, or whether it should be played forward followed by played in reverse, iteratively.
   permissible value - value meaning
      true - When looping, the movie should be played in the forward direction, followed by the reverse direction, iteratively.
      false - When looping, the movie should only be played in the forward direction. This is the default behavior.
