    <section name="Tool Execution">
<p>The execution steps are as follows:</p>
   <ol>
       <li>The input XML document is parsed and the contents are validated against the master database.</li>
      <li>The validated contents are integrated into the master database.</li>
      <li>The XML Schema and Schematron files are written.</li>
      <li>The process report and spreadsheet are written.</li>
   </ol>

      <subsection name="Execute LDDTool">
<source>
<b>If the host platform is a Mac or Unix system, type the following commands: </b>

cd  ./LDDTool/bin

lddtool -lp [inputfilename] > lddtool.log

<b>If the host platform is a Windows system, type the following commands: </b>

cd .\LDDTool\bin

lddtool.bat -lp [inputfilename] > lddtool.log

<b>Note:</b>  The input file to LDDTool is an XML document that contains a completed
       local data dictionary template. This file must conform to the
       PDS4 Ingest_LDDTool schema.

       The output files written by LDDTool are:
                  - an XML Schema file (.xsd),
                  - a Schematron file (.sch),
                  - a process report file (.txt),
                  - a spreadsheet file (.csv) containing the local data dictionary information.
       All output files are generated in the current directory. 
       They bear the same name as the input file name.
