   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description            The original_band attribute of a spectral qube provides the sequence of band numbers in the qube relative to some original qube. In the original qube, the values are just consecutive integers beginning with 1. In a qube which contains a subset of the bands in the original qube, the values are the original sequence numbers from that qube.
