"geom:Image_Display_Geometry:1        ","Class","Image_Display_Geometry","1.0.0.0","geom","Image_Display_Geometry class provides an unambiguous description of the orientation of the image contents. Given an image, displayed as described by the Display_Direction class, any one of the Object_Orientation_* classes should allow unambiguous orientation of the contents of the image. The use of disp:Display_Direction is optional, but must be given either here or in the Display Discipline Area of the label. The Object_Orientation_North_East class is typically used for instruments for which the entire field of view is a portion of the target surface (e.g., instruments on Mars orbital spacecraft); otherwise use Object_Orientation_RA_Dec (e.g., flyby missions, missions with orbit radii much larger than the target radius such as Voyager or Cassini). At least one of these must be used. The three _Identification classes used here are Central_Body (e.g., Saturn if you are using Planetocentric or planetographic coordinates in the Saturn system); Body is typically used in lieu of Central_Body when the coordinates are based on a comet, asteroid, KBO, or satellite; Target when the described object in the FoV is not the Central_Body or Body. For example giving the orientation of the pole of Enceladus in Saturn Planetocentric coordinates, Central_Body = Saturn, Target = Enceladus. Bottom line: put in enough information so someone else can figure out the orientation of the field of view. ","geo","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, higher values of emission_angle indicate more oblique viewing of the target. Values in the range of 90 to 180 degrees are possible for ring data.
