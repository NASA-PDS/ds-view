        Other Significant Updates External to the Common Dictionary
        The version identifier of the Information Model is used for many purposes, including being inserted as part of the file name for almost all system files that are auto-generated for the release.
        To be inserted into the filename, the version identifier must have the dots "." removed, for example "1900" is derived from "1.9.0.0".  However for this release the insert "11000" results from "1.10.0.0".
        This insert causes problems with ordering as well as being ambiguous.  After some consultation it was decided to use the insert "1.A.0.0" for this release.  For example PDS4_PDS_1A00.xsd is the name of the 
        XML Schema file for this release.  System programmers will immediately identify the change from the decimal to the hexadecimal numbering system.  (base-10 to base-16).
