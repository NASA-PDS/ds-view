    <section name="About Model Ontology">
      <p>The PDS4 Model Ontology component encapsulates the Protégé ontology instances for the PDS4 information and data model. This package uses the Maven plugin "model-dmdocument" to generate documentation and other artifcats from the ontology and packages this output (including generated, DM documentation, classes and attribute definitions) into a JAR file.
      </p>
      <p>To generate the output artifacts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the Protégé output ontology instances in the <code>src/ontology</code> directory. (The output must go into a <code>Data</code> subdirectory beneath <code>src/ontology</code> due to the way the DM-Document plugin assumes things work).
        </li>
        <li>Commit these changes to revision control (with <code>svn commit</code>, for example).</li>
        <li>Run <code>mvn jar:jar</code> to generate a <code>target/model-ontology-VERSION.jar</code> file that contains all of the generate artifacts.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Please send comments, change requests and bug reports to the <a href="mailto:pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov">PDS Operator</a> at pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov.
