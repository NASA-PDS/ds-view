    The FLUX_STRUCTURE consists of two values (data pairs): a data value
    (DVAL), and standard deviation (STDVAL). Although the actual number of
    data pairs provided varies from file to file, 6 pairs are provided for
    all files, with any extra values being filled with a flag value of
    -9.99999e+10. The table provided below indicates the number of data pairs
    provided, the particle measured, and the units given for each data file.
