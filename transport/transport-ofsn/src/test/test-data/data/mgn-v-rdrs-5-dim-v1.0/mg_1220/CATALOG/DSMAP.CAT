      Resolution Radar Mosaic) is presented in a Sinusoidal Equal-            
      Area map projection. In this projection, parallels of latitude          
      are straight lines, with constant distances between equal               
      latitude intervals. Lines of constant longitude on either side          
      of the projection meridian are curved since longitude                   
      intervals decrease with the cosine of latitude to account for           
      their convergence toward the poles. This projection offers a            
      number of advantages for storing and managing global digital            
      data; in particular, it is computationally simple, and data             
      are stored in a compact form.                                           
                                                                              
      The Sinusoidal Equal-Area projection is characterized by a              
      projection longitude, which is the center meridian of the               
      projection, and a scale, which is given in units of pixels/             
      degree. A projection longitude is defined for each FMAP; all            
      tiles within the FMAP use the same projection longitude.  The           
      center latitude for all FMAPs is the equator.                           
                                                                              
      The transformation from latitude and longitude to line and              
      sample is given by the following equations:                             
                                                                              
      line = INT(LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - lat*MAP_RESOLUTION + 1.0)           
                                                                              
      sample = INT(SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - (lon -                          
               CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*cos(lat) + 1.0)               
                                                                              
      Note that integral values of line and sample correspond to the          
      center of a pixel. Lat and lon are the latitude and longitude           
      of a given spot on the surface.                                         
                                                                              
      LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the line number minus one on which            
      the map projection origin occurs. The map projection origin             
      is the intersection of the equator and the projection longitude.        
      The value of LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is positive for images              
      starting north of the equator and is negative for images                
      starting south of the equator.                                          
                                                                              
      SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the nearest sample number to the            
      left of the projection longitude. The value of SAMPLE_                  
      PROJECTION_OFFSET is positive for images starting to the west           
      of the projection longitude and is negative for images starting         
      to the east of the projection longitude.                                
                                                                              
      CENTER_LONGITUDE is the value of the projection longitude,              
      which is the longitude that passes through the center of the            
      projection.                                                             
                                                                              
      MAP_RESOLUTION is measured in pixels/degree.  FMAP products can         
      have possible resolutions of 1408, 235, and 35.                         
                                                                              
      There are four PDS parameters that specify the latitude and             
      longitude boundaries of an image.  MAXIMUM_LATITUDE and                 
      MINIMUM_LATITUDE specify the latitude boundaries of the image,          
      and EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE and WESTERNMOST_LONGITUDE specify the         
      longitudinal boundaries of the map.
