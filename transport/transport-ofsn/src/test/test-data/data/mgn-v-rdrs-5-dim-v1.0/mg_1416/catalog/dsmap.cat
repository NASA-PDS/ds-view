    MAP_PROJECTION_DESC           = "The FMAP (Magellan Full                  
      Resolution Radar Mosaic) is presented in a Sinusoidal Equal-            
      Area map projection. In this projection, parallels of latitude          
      are straight lines, with constant distances between equal               
      latitude intervals. Lines of constant longitude on either side          
      of the projection meridian are curved since longitude                   
      intervals decrease with the cosine of latitude to account for           
      their convergence toward the poles. This projection offers a            
      number of advantages for storing and managing global digital            
      data; in particular, it is computationally simple, and data             
      are stored in a compact form.                                           
                                                                              
      The Sinusoidal Equal-Area projection is characterized by a              
      projection longitude, which is the center meridian of the               
      projection, and a scale, which is given in units of pixels/             
      degree. A projection longitude is defined for each FMAP; all            
      tiles within the FMAP use the same projection longitude.  The           
      center latitude for all FMAPs is the equator.                           
                                                                              
      The transformation from latitude and longitude to line and              
      sample is given by the following equations:                             
                                                                              
      line = INT(LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - lat*MAP_RESOLUTION + 1.0)           
                                                                              
      sample = INT(SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - (lon -                          
               CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*cos(lat) + 1.0)               
                                                                              
      Note that integral values of line and sample correspond to the          
      center of a pixel. Lat and lon are the latitude and longitude           
      of a given spot on the surface.                                         
                                                                              
      LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the line number minus one on which            
      the map projection origin occurs. The map projection origin             
      is the intersection of the equator and the projection longitude.        
      The value of LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is positive for images              
      starting north of the equator and is negative for images                
      starting south of the equator.                                          
                                                                              
      SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the nearest sample number to the            
      left of the projection longitude. The value of SAMPLE_                  
      PROJECTION_OFFSET is positive for images starting to the west           
      of the projection longitude and is negative for images starting         
      to the east of the projection longitude.                                
                                                                              
      CENTER_LONGITUDE is the value of the projection longitude,              
      which is the longitude that passes through the center of the            
      projection.                                                             
                                                                              
      MAP_RESOLUTION is measured in pixels/degree.  FMAP products can         
      have possible resolutions of 1408, 235, and 35.                         
                                                                              
      There are four PDS parameters that specify the latitude and             
      longitude boundaries of an image.  MAXIMUM_LATITUDE and                 
      MINIMUM_LATITUDE specify the latitude boundaries of the image,          
      and EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE and WESTERNMOST_LONGITUDE specify the         
      longitudinal boundaries of the map.                                     
                                                                              
      Definitions of other mapping parameters can be found in the             
      PDS Data dictionary.                                                    
                                                                              
      **NOTE**:  The FMAP CD-ROM volume set does not fully comply with        
      PDS map projection standards.  The line_projection_offset and           
      sample_projection_offset keywords in the Image_Map_Projection           
      Object of the FMAP products are set opposite to the way they are        
      defined in the Planetary Science Data Dictionary (PSDD).  The           
      above equations for converting from lat/lon to line/sample are          
      also in error.  The correct equations are as follows:                   
                                                                              
      line = INT(LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - lat*MAP_RESOLUTION)                 
                                                                              
      sample = INT(SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET + (lon -                          
               CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*cos(lat))                     
                                                                              
      The value of 1.0 does not need to be added to either equation           
      because the line_projection_offset and sample_projection_offset         
      have already been translated to a (1,1) origin as defined in the        
      PSDD.  The equations were originally taken from the MDIM CD-ROM         
      volume set which were not translated to a (1,1) origin.  The            
      equation for calculating the sample had a sign change because           
      the direction of positive longitude is East instead of West             
      as it was in the MDIM products.                                         
                                                                              
      A software patch has been included on this disk to correct the          
      line_projection_offset and sample_projection_offset keywords on         
      FMAP products.  The name of the program is PATCH and it is              
      stored in the SOFTWARE directory.  There is a version included          
      for each of the platforms supported by this disk.  PATCH is a           
      command line driven program and can be run in either of                 
      the two following ways:                                                 
                                                                              
      patch from to                                                           
                                                                              
      patch from                                                              
                                                                              
      The from parameter is the name of an input FMAP image.  The to          
      parameter is the name of the output FMAP image with corrected           
      label information.  If you do not specify an output image file          
      name, then the program will correct the labels in the input             
      image file.  You would probably only want to use both from and          
      to parameters if you are correcting labels of images directly off       
      of the CD-ROM.                                                          
                                                                              
      Please refer to the SOFTINFO.TXT file in the SOFTWARE directory for     
      information on compiling and linking this program for different         
      operating systems.  The same commands used to compile and link          
      the software described in that text file were used to create the        
      executeable versions of the PATCH program on this disk."
