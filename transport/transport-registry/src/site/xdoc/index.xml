    <section name="About Transport Service">
      <p>The Transport Service provides functionality for transporting and transforming PDS products. The core functionality for this service is satisfied by the Apache OODT Web Grid Product Server and includes a handler for interfacing with the Registry Service and a handler for interfacing with the Search Service. It is typically invoked from hyperlinks embedded in the results returned by the Search Service.
      </p>

      <p>The Transport Service is composed by the following components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Apache OODT Web Grid servlet, which provides a general-purpose web container for answering transport requests formulated as HTTP GET or POST requests.</li>
        <li>The Apache OODT Product Server, which routes each transport request to a handler that interfaces with the Registry Service or Search Service.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please send comments, change requests and bug reports to the <a href="mailto:pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov">PDS Operator</a> at pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov.
