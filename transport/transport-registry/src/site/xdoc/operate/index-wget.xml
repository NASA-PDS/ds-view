    <section name="Using Wget">
      <p>Although <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/" target="_blank">cURL</a> is the command-line application of choice for interacting with the Transport Service software, some machines may only have <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/wget/" target="_blank">Wget</a> installed or some users may prefer <i>Wget</i> over <i>cURL</i>. The functionality of each application is essentially the same. This document describes the differences between the two applications.
      </p>

      <p>The following command provides an example of using <i>cURL</i> to retrieve a product from the Transpot Service application:
      </p>

      <source>
% curl -X GET -o package.zip -v \
http://localhost:8080/transport/prod?q=identifier+EQ+&lt;LID|LIDVID&gt;
      </source>

      <p>The same action can be achieved using <i>Wget</i> with the following command:
      </p>

      <source>
% wget -v -O package.zip \
http://localhost:8080/transport/prod?q=identifier+EQ+&lt;LID|LIDVID&gt;
      </source>
