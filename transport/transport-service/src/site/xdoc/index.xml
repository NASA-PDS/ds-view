    <section name="About Transport Service">
      
      <p>
      	The Transport Service provides the capability to access, download and transform PDS products. 
      	It is typically invoked from hyperlinks embedded in the results returned by the Search Service.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	The Transport Service is composed by the following components (top to bottom):
	  	<ul>
			<li>The Apache OODT Web Grid servlet, 
				which provides a general-purpose web container for answering transport requests formulated as HTTP/GET.</li>
				
			<li>The Apache OODT Product Server, which routes each transport request to a PDS-specific OFSN (Online File Specification Name) Handler. 
			    The PDS OFSN Handlers contain functionality for delivering data products to web clients by invoking the appropriate
			    product transformation.</li>
			
			<li>The PDS Transformation Services, which provide a general utility for invoking image transformations of different types.</li>
			
			<li>The suite of back-end image transformation libraries.</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>
