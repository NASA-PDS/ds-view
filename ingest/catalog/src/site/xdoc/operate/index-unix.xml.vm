    <section name="UNIX Setup Options">
      <p>This section details a couple of options for setting up a UNIX environment for launching CITool.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Specify the CLASSPATH on the Command-Line">
        <p>An alternative method to setting the <i>CLASSPATH</i> variable with all of the tool's dependent JAR files is to specify the <i>java.ext.dirs</i> Java property on the command-line when running the tool each time. This is done by passing the property via the Java "-D" flag as demonstrated in the following example:
        </p>

        <source>
% java -Djava.ext.dirs=$HOME/${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}/lib \
gov.nasa.pds.citool.CITool &lt;command-line arguments&gt;
        </source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Specify the JAR on the Command-Line">
        <p>Another alternative method is to specify the executable JAR file on the command-line when running the tool each time. This is done by passing the JAR file specification via the Java "-jar" flag as demonstrated in the following example:
        </p>

        <source>
% java -jar $HOME/${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}/lib/${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}.jar &lt;command-line arguments&gt;
        </source>
