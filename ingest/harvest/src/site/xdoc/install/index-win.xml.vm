      <p>The required environment variables for the <i>${xdoc-artifactId}</i> package can also be set through the Windows system properties panel. The <i>Path</i> environment variable can be modified as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Right-click on <i>My Computer</i> icon on your desktop and select the <i>Properties</i> menu item.
        </li>
        <li>Navigate to the <i>Advanced</i> tab and select the <i>Environment Variables</i> button. At this point, you should now see a window like the one below:
        </li>
      </ul>

      <center><img src="../images/windows_panel.jpg"/></center>

      <ul>
        <li>Highlight the <i>Path</i> variable in the System Variables list and select the <i>Edit</i> button.
        </li>
        <li>Append to the current contents of the variable, the path to the <i>bin</i> directory within <i>${xdoc-artifactId}</i> package. Separate the package path from the current contents of the variable with a semicolon.
        </li>
        <li>Select the <i>OK</i> button when you are finished editing the <i>Path</i> variable, then select the <i>OK</i> button on the Environment Variables window to apply the changes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>New environment variables (e.g., JAVA_HOME) may also be specified in the system properties panel. Instead of selecting the <i>Edit</i> button from the System Variables list, select the <i>New</i> button and enter the variable name and value. Select the <i>OK</i> button when you are finished, then select the <i>OK</i> button on the Environment Variables window to apply the changes.
      </p>

      <p>Note: If you already have a DOS window open, you will need to close and re-open the window for the environment variable changes to take effect.
