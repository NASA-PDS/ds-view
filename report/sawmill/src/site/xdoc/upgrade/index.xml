        <p>This section describes the procedure for upgrading a previously installed version of Sawmill to a newer version.

	<table>
	  <tr><th>Machine Name</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>pdsrpt1</td><td>operations</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>pdsrpt2</td><td>operations</td></tr>
	</table>

	<p><i>Note: The following procedure needs to be completed for <b><u>pdsrpt1</u></b> only.  The instructions will explicitly denote instructions for upgrading pdsrpt2.</i></p>

        <ol>
          <li>Log onto the pdsrpt1.</li>
	  <li>sudo su pds</li>
	  <li>Place the downloaded Sawmill tar in the /home/pds directory</li>
          <li>Navigate to /home/pds and enter the following command from the command line:
            <source>
% gunzip -c (sawmill.tar.gz) | tar xf -
            </source>
            <p>A directory called <i>sawmill</i> is created containing the software and configuration.
            </p>
          </li>
	  <li>Move the directory to a more version-specific location so it is maintained:
	    <source>
% mv sawmill sawmill8.6.3.1
	    </source>
	  </li>
	  <li>Run <a href="http://starcell.jpl.nasa.gov/repo/2010/trunk/report/sawmill/src/main/resources/bin/upgrade-sawmill">upgrade-sawmill</a> to remove the Sawmill default configurations and copy the PDS Engineering-specific configurations from the old installation.
	    <source>
# Usage: upgrade-sawmill &lt;new-LogAnalysisInfo&gt;
./upgrade-sawmill /home/pds/sawmill8.6.1.3/LogAnalysisInfo
	    </source>
	    <p><b>Note: This assumes <i>/report_service/LogAnalysisInfo</i> is home to current installation's LogAnalysisInfo.  Update the script if needed.</b></p>
	  </li>
          <li>To run Sawmill, execute the following commands:
            <source>
cd /home/pds/sawmill8.6.3.1
nohup ./sawmill -ws t -v e > ~/sawmill_&lt;current_date_in_YYYYMMDD_formate&gt;.log 2>&amp;1&amp;
            </source>
	    <p><i>Note: Be sure to modify this command, as needed for the shell being used, to ensure Sawmill runs as a daemon process and output is redirected into .</i>
	    </p>
          </li>
	  <li>Log onto pdsrpt2</li>
	  <li>Complete steps 1-5 from above on pdsrpt2</li>
	  <li><p>Perform the following in the bash shell:</p>
	    <source>
rm -fr /home/pds/sawmill8.6.1.3/LogAnalysisInfo
ln -s /report_service/LogAnalysisInfo /home/pds/sawmill8.6.1.3/LogAnalysisInfo
	    </source>
	    <p><i>Note: Modify directories as needed to reflect actual installation directories.</i></p>
	    </li>
	  <li>Complete step 7 from above on pdsrpt2.</li>
          <li>Open a web browser and go to http://pdsrpt.jpl.nasa.gov/ to open Sawmill.</li>
          <li>Verify you can login using your PDS username and password.</li>
