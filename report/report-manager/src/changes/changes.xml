        Created new staging command-line variable to allow specification of a staging directory to be fed into the PushPull API. Removed database.properties because it was leftover from rs-update and is no longer needed. Updated environment.properties with updated paths. Had to update the oodt-version Maven variable to an actual value because it was not picking it up from parent.
