    <section name="About Report Service">
      <p>The Report component provides functionality for capturing and reporting metrics. Although each new service will have functional requirements to track metrics, those metrics should be submitted to this service via a common interface or captured in a common format so that they can be harvested by this service. The service is not limited to metrics generated by PDS 2010 services, but should also include metrics from the FTP and web logs from each of the nodes as well as any other commonly generated metric.
