    <section name="Unpacking the Package">
      <p>Download the <i>${xdoc-artifactId}</i> package from the yet to be developed PDS 2010 web page. The binary distribution is available in identical zip or tar/gzip packages. Unpack the selected binary distribution file with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      <source>
% unzip ${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}-bin.zip
or
% tar -xzvf ${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}-bin.tar.gz
      </source>

      <p>Note: Depending on the platform, the native version of <i>tar</i> may produce an error when attempting to unpack the distribution file because many of the file paths are greater than 100 characters. If available, the GNU version of tar will resolve this problem. If that is not available or cannot be installed, the zipped package will work just fine in a UNIX environment.
      </p>

      <p>The commands above result in the creation of the <i>${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}</i> directory with the following directory structure:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>README.txt</b><br/>
          <p>A README file directing the user to the available documentation for the project.
          </p>
