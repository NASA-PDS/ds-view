        <source>
% update-tool
        </source>

        </p>

        <source>
% update-tool -l log.txt
        </source>
        
        <p>The following command demonstrates how to run the Update Tool for a specified profile only, i.e. <i>img-web</i>:
        </p>

        <source>
% update-tool -n img-web
        </source>
