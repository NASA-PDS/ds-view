    <section name="Installation">
      <p>This document describes how to install the Search Service software contained in the <i>${project.artifactId}</i> package. The following topics can be found in this section:

    <section name="System Requirements">
      <p>This section details the system requirements for installing and operating the Search Service.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Java Runtime Environment">
        <p>The Search Service was developed using Java and <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">Apache Solr</a> and will run on any platform with a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The software was specifically developed under Java version 1.6 and has only been tested with this version. The following commands test the local Java installation in a UNIX-based environment:
        </p>

        <source>
% which java
/usr/bin/java

% java -version
java version "1.6.0_26"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03-384-10M3425)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.1-b02-384, mixed mode)
        </source>

        <p>The first command above checks whether the <i>java</i> executable is in the environment's path and the second command reports the version. If Java is not installed or the version is not at least 1.6, Java will need to be downloaded and installed in the current environment. Consult the local system administrator for installation of this software. For the do-it-yourself crowd, the Java software can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/" target="_blank">Oracle Java Download</a> page. The software package of choice is the Java Standard Edition (SE) 6, either the JDK or the JRE package. The JDK package is not necessary to run the software but could be useful if development and compilation of Java software will also occur in the current environment.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Java Application Server">
        <p>The Registry Service requires a Java application server for hosting the web application. The suggested application server for this release is Apache Tomcat with a minimal version of 6.0.20 through version 7.0.X. Consult the local system administrator for installation of this software. For the do-it-yourself crowd, the Apache Tomcat software can be downloaded from the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Tomcat</a> page. Choose the version to download (6.0 or 7.0) from the menu on the left.
        </p>
      </subsection>
    </section>
    <section name="Unpacking the Package">
      <p>Download the <i>${project.artifactId}</i> package from the PDS <a href="ftp://pds.nasa.gov/pub/toplevel/2010/search/" target="_blank">FTP</a> site. The binary distribution is available in identical zip or tar/gzip packages. The installation directory may vary from environment to environment but in UNIX-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>/usr/local</i> directory and in Windows-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>C:\Program Files</i> directory. Unpack the selected binary distribution file with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      <source>
% unzip ${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-bin.zip
or
% tar -xzvf ${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-bin.tar.gz
      </source>

      <p>Note: Depending on the platform, the native version of <i>tar</i> may produce an error when attempting to unpack the distribution file because many of the file paths are greater than 100 characters. If available, the GNU version of tar will resolve this problem. If that is not available or cannot be installed, the zipped package will work just fine in a UNIX environment.
      </p>

      <p>The commands above result in the creation of the <i>${project.artifactId}-${project.version}</i> directory with the following directory structure:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>README.txt</b><br/>
          <p>A README file directing the user to the available documentation for the project.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>LICENSE.txt</b><br/>
          <p>The copyright notice from the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a> detailing the restrictions regarding the use and distribution of this software. Although the license is strictly worded, the software has been classified as Technology and Software Publicly Available (TSPA) and is available for <i>anyone</i> to download and use.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>doc/</b><br/>
          <p>This directory contains a local web site with the Search Service documentation, javadoc, unit test results and other configuration management related information. Just point the desired web browser to the <i>index.html</i> file in this directory.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section name="Deploying the Application">
      <p>The Search Service is the Solr configuration along with the Java extensions written to support PDS Search Protocol and PDAP Handler. In order to deploy Solr with the Search Service configuration, please complete the following procedure:
      </p>

      <subsection name="Initial Installation">
	<ol>
	  <li>Create a symbolic link to the Search Service installation directory to provide an easier method of upgrade in the future.  The following demonstrates how to create this symbolic link:
	    <source>
ln -s /usr/local/${project.artifactId} /usr/local/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}
	    </source>
	  </li>
	  <li>Create a Tomcat context file <i>${project.artifactId}.xml</i> to refer to the Solr war (found in the $SEARCH_SERVICE_HOME directory) and place it in the <i>$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost</i> directory.  The <i>${project.artifactId}.xml</i> file should look something like this:
	    <source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Context docBase="/usr/local/${project.artifactId}/solr.war" debug="0" crossContext="true"&gt;
  &lt;Environment name="solr/home" type="java.lang.String" value="/usr/local/${project.artifactId}" override="true" /&gt;
  &lt;Environment name="javax/xml/transform/TransformerFactory" type="java.lang.String" value="net/sf/saxon/TransformerFactoryImpl" override="true"/&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
	    </source>
	  </li>
	  <li>Modify $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/catalina.sh (or /etc/init.d/tomcat) by inserting the following into the top of the document in order to set the following environment variables:
	    <source>
CATALINA_OPTS="${CATALINA_OPTS} -Dsolr.pds.home=/usr/local/${project.artifactId}"
CATALINA_OPTS="${CATALINA_OPTS} -Djavax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory=net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl"

CLASSPATH="${CLASSPATH}:/usr/local/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}/lib/saxon-9.jar"
	    </source>
	  </li>
	  <li>Restart Tomcat server</li>
	  <li>Test installation by going to http://localhost:8080/${project.artifactId}/ (<i>Domain and port will vary according to Tomcat configuration</i>)</li>
	</ol>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Upgrade To Newer Version">
	<ol>
	  <li>Change Search Service symbolic link to new location:
	    <source>
rm /usr/local/${project.artifactId}

ln -s /usr/local/${project.artifactId} /usr/local/${project.artifactId}-${project-version}
	    </source>
	  </li>
	  <li>Restart Tomcat server</li>
	  <li>Test installation by going to http://localhost:8080/${project.artifactId}/ (<i>Domain and port will vary according to Tomcat configuration</i>)</li>
	</ol>
