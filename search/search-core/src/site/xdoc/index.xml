    <section name="About Search Core">
      <p>The Search Core is a software tool, build in accordance with the Search Service to provide searching capabilities for PDS Engineering data extracted from Registry Services.  Its purpose is to provide the basis for creating a Lucene Index and searching it through an <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> web application.  This index can then be leveraged by other software to provide a searchable user interface to a prospective user.  The Search Core software itself has a command-line interface and API to provide this functionality.
      </p>

      <p>Please send comments, change requests and bug reports to the <a href="mailto:pds_operator@jpl.nasa.g
ov">PDS Operator</a> at pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="Main Components">
      <p>
  The following section describes the main functionality and components of the Search Core.  These components are combined to produce a searchable index through a web interface, such as the PDS Engineering saerch <a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/data-search">Data Search page</a>.  
      </p>
      <subsection name="Command-line Interface">
	<p>
	  Provides command-line interaction with the tool in order to run it according to customer needs.
	</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Registry Extractor">
        <p>This component uses the Registry Core and XML configuration files to build XML documents on a per product basis.  The Registry context products queried through the software are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Product_Data_Set_PDS3</li>
          <li>Product_Target_PDS3</li>
          <li>Product_Instrument_PDS3</li>
          <li>Product_Instrument_Host_PDS3</li>
          <li>Product_Mission_PDS3</li>
          <li>Product_Context (indirectly through Association)</li>
        </ul>
	<p>The purpose for these files is they will be combined using the Solr Indexer component to form a Lucene index.
	</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Solr Indexer">
        <p>
          The Solr Indexer leverages <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html">Apache Lucene</a> and the XML document(s) produced by the Registry Extractor to produce a searchable index file that can be ingested by the Solr web application to provided an indexed search capability.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Solr Post">
	<p>
	  This component leverages the index created from the Solr Indexer, XSLT Stylesheets, and XML hierarchy configurations to post data to the Search Service Solr instance.  This functionality is provided by Shell scripts located in the tool's /bin directory.
	</p>
	<p>
	<i>Note: Future enhancements will capture this functionality in the Search Core command-line interface.</i>
