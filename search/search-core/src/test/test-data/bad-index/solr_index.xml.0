      =================
      Instrument P.I.       : John D. Richardson
      Data Supplier         : John D. Richardson
      Data sampling rate    : 96 seconds
      Data Set Start Time   : 1981-08-19T00:00:09.229Z
      Data Set Stop Time    : 1981-09-04T02:51:21.885Z
 
      This data set contains solar wind plasma browse data near the Voyager
      2 Saturn encounter. Moment parameters are given. Since only the first
      72 or last 72 energy/charge channels are telemetered to Earth from
      each M-mode spectra, derived parameters change significantly only
      every other set of spectra so the effective time resolution is 96
      second.
 
      Parameters
      ==========
 
      Data Set Parameter 'ION DENSITY'
      --------------------------------
      Data Set Parameter Name        : ION DENSITY
      Data Set Parameter Unit        : CM**-3
      Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME
      Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND
      Minimum Sampling Parameter     : UNK
      Maximum Sampling Parameter     : UNK
      Sampling Parameter Interval    : UNK
      Minimum Available Sampling Int : UNK
      Noise Level                    : UNK
 
      A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per unit
      volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,
      or energy/nucleon. Discrimination with regard to mass and or
      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,
      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument
      limitations.
 
      Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are
      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or
      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of
      moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will
      be provided in a single data set. In general, if more than
      one ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total
      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion
      densities. If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian
      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as
      the sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of
      each Maxwellian is given.
 
      Data Set Parameter 'ION TEMPERATURE'
      ------------------------------------
      Data Set Parameter Name        : ION TEMPERATURE
      Data Set Parameter Unit        : EV
      Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME
      Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND
      Minimum Sampling Parameter     : UNK
      Maximum Sampling Parameter     : UNK
      Sampling Parameter Interval    : UNK
      Minimum Available Sampling Int : UNK
      Noise Level                    : UNK
 
      A derived parameter giving an indication of the mean
      energy/ion, assuming the shape of the ion energy spectrum to
      be Maxwellian. Given that the ion energy spectrum is not
      exactly Maxwellian, the ion temperature can be defined
      integrally (whereby the mean energy obtained by integrating
      under the actual ion energy spectrum is set equal to the
      integral under a Maxwellian, where the temperature is a free
      parameter for which to solve), or differentially (whereby the
      slopes of the actually ion energy spectrum at various energies
      are matched to the slopes of a corresponding Maxwellian). The
      temperature parameter is often qualified with a range of
      applicable energies. Temperatures can be angularly
      anisotropic. If the ions do not have a Maxwellian distribution
      the actual distribution can be represented as the sum of
      several Maxwellians, each with a separate temperature.
 
      Data Set Parameter 'ION THERMAL SPEED'
      --------------------------------------
      Data Set Parameter Name        : ION THERMAL SPEED
      Data Set Parameter Unit        : KM/S
      Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME
      Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND
      Minimum Sampling Parameter     : UNK
      Maximum Sampling Parameter     : UNK
      Sampling Parameter Interval    : UNK
      Minimum Available Sampling Int : UNK
      Noise Level                    : UNK
 
      A measure of the velocity associated with the temperature of
      the ions. It is formally defined as the Ion Thermal Speed
      squared equals two times K (Boltzmann's constant) times T
      (temperature of ion) divided by M (ion mass). Each component
      of a plasma has a thermal speed associated with it.
 
      Data Set Parameter 'ION VELOCITY'
      ---------------------------------
      Data Set Parameter Name        : ION VELOCITY
      Data Set Parameter Unit        : KM/S
      Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME
      Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND
      Minimum Sampling Parameter     : UNK
      Maximum Sampling Parameter     : UNK
      Sampling Parameter Interval    : UNK
      Minimum Available Sampling Int : UNK
      Noise Level                    : UNK
 
      A derived parameter giving the average speed and direction of
      motion of a plasma or plasma component. The velocity can be
      obtained by taking the first moment of the distribution
      function or by simulating the observations with some known
      distribution function, usually a Maxwellian, to the
      distribution. Velocities are given in Heliographic (RTN)
      coordinates:
 
        R is radially away from sun,
        T is in plane of sun's equator and positive in the direction
          of solar rotation
        N completes right-handed system

      Global Reflectivity Data Record (GREDR).  The power reflection
      coefficients are derived by fitting altimeter echoes from the
      fan-beam altimetry antenna as a function of time to Hagfors'
      radar backscatter model templates.  The values are then
      corrected for the presence of multiple echo peaks and further
      corrected for diffuse scattering using backscatter data
      obtained by the side-looking mode of the Magellan radar.  The
      reflectivities are then filtered to remove low-frequency
      instrument calibration errors, and re-sampled into sinusoidal,
      Mercator, and north and south polar stereographic projections
      at a resolution of about 5x5 kilometers per pixel.  Each GREDR
      image pixel is represented by a 8-bit unsigned integer.  In
      sinusoidal images, pixels lying outside the domain of the
      projection are set to zero.  In all images, pixels with unknown
      or unmeasured values are also set to zero.  The remaining
      values are related to the reflectivity by the following
      equation:
 
        DN = (REFLECTIVITY * 200) + 1.

<field name="data_set_description"><![CDATA[Data Set Overview
    =================
      This data set consists of raw data collected during the Saturn
      egress radio occultation of Voyager 1 on 13 November 1980 plus
      ancillary files that might be useful in analysis of those data.
      The raw data are sampled voltage outputs from receivers tuned to
      the Voyager carrier frequencies at both S-band and X-band during
      the occultation.  The data have been reduced to give profiles
      of temperature and pressure as a function of height in the
      atmosphere [LINDALETAL1985], to infer magnetic field
      orientations in the upper ionosphere [HINSON1984], and to
      determine the distribution of particles [MAROUFETAL1986] and
      particle properties [ZEBKERETAL1985] in the ring system.
 
      During the Saturn occultation, the Voyager 1 spacecraft
      provided a coherent, dual-frequency microwave radio signal
      source.  The signal frequency was derived from a precision,
      onboard Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO).  The spacecraft
      high-gain antenna (HGA) beamed that signal through the
      atmosphere and rings of Saturn.  As the spacecraft moved on
      its trajectory, the radio signal probed the atmosphere and
      rings at different radial positions from the center of mass.
      An hour later the signals were received using a 64-meter
      antenna of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) near Madrid
      (Spain).
 
      To keep the refracted radio beam aimed toward the DSN antenna
      during the atmospheric occultation, the spacecraft attitude
      was adjusted so that the high-gain antenna (HGA) was pointed
      at the virtual image of Earth on Saturn's limb.  This ensured
      that maximum signal strength would be available from the
      deepest probing.  After the ring occultation, the HGA was
      turned from its normal Earth-pointing direction toward the
      rings; a forward-scattering experiment was conducted before
      normal Earth-pointing operations resumed about 100 minutes
      later.
 
      Related data sets of possible interest include:

    Parameters
    ==========
      The output of each S-band receiver was a sinusoidal carrier
      signal embedded in noise -- a voltage with bandwidth
      approximately 50 kHz and sampled at 300000 samples per second.
      The X-band receiver output was similar; but, because of greater
      potential for Doppler drift and prediction uncertainty, its
      bandwidth was 150 kHz and sampling rate was 300000 samples per
      second.  Voltages typically were in the range +/- 10 volts;
      but the absolute levels were not calibrated.  In fact, they
      are generally not needed since it is the frequency (or phase)
      of the signal (rather than amplitude) that is most useful in
      inferring properties of a neutral atmosphere or ionosphere,
      and amplitude calibration for ring observations can be
      obtained by referencing signals to the background radiothermal
      noise in the data stream.
 
      The frequency of the USO was known from monitoring during the
      Jupiter-Saturn cruise (and from post-Saturn observations).
      Doppler contributions from motions of the spacecraft, Earth,
      Saturn, and other bodies of the solar system were determined
      jointly with the Voyager Navigation Team.  Relativistic
      Doppler contributions could be estimated from proximity to
      large masses.  Receiver tuning was recorded in POCA
      (Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly) files, which are
      included with this archive.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      No processing per se has been carried out on these data.
      However, because of the high sampling rate, the 8-bit samples
      were recorded originally on wide-bandwidth analog video tape.
      The analog tapes were then replayed later at slower speeds and
      the digital data were extracted onto computer compatible tapes
      (CCTs) with each receiver channel on a separate set of tapes.
      Because the S-band data had been oversampled originally
      (300 ksps for a 50 kHz bandwidth), only one of every three
      samples was saved during the transfer of S-band data to CCTs.
      This process, known as 'decimation', meant that 300 seconds
      of data could be stored on an S-band CCT whereas only
      100 seconds of X-band data would fit.
 
      Because analog recording technology was required to save the
      high data rate digital samples, there are occasional dropouts
      in the sample stream.  These can be detected by paying special
      attention to counter fields in data record headers.
 
      Two analog recorders (A and B) were available at each DSN
      complex.   Because a single recorder could not capture the
      entire set of Saturn occultation activities, the two were run
      in parallel with staggered start/stop times.  Most data were
      collected using Recorder A; but Recorder B was used to
      capture the samples while Recorder A was being reloaded.
 
 
    Data
    ====
      Primary data were delivered to Voyager Radio Science Team
      members in the form of 30 megabyte (MB) CCTs covering
      300 s (S-band) or 100 s (X-band).  Each tape had  6000
      records of 5056 bytes (56 bytes of header information
      and 5000 8-bit samples of receiver output voltage).  Tapes
      were numbered sequentially as CCTs were generated from the
      high density video originals.  Tapes with Saturn data from
      Recorders A and B were numbered as follows:
 
               1980-11-13 UTC        Tape  Numbers   Recorder
             -----------------       -------------   --------
             03:35:00-04:35:00       VJ6185-VJ6280       A
             04:05:00-05:05:00       VJ6089-VJ6184       B
             04:45:00-05:40:00       VJ6001-VJ6088       A
             05:35:00-06:00:00       VJ6509-VJ6548       B
             05:55:00-06:50:00       VJ6381-VJ6468       A
             06:45:00-07:10:00       VJ6549-VJ6588       B
             07:05:00-07:30:00       VJ6469-VJ6508       A
 
      Test and calibration data after the Saturn encounter were
      collected on Recorder A and have numbers VJ6612 through VJ6651.
 
      The original tape numbering has been preserved in the current
      file names, which have the form VJnnnnCC.ODR.  On tapes where
      one or more records could not be read, the original has been
      separated into two or more files.  The character 'C' indicates
      the ordering of these file fragments with 'A' being first (and
      the default with no tape reading errors), 'B' next, etc.
 
      Each Original Data Record (ODR) file is accompanied by a
      minimal PDS label briefly describing the contents and referring
      the user to detailed documentation on file format.  The label
      file has name  VJnnnnCC.LBL.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
      Geometry Data - The raw radio data were originally reduced by
      the Voyager Radio Science Team using ephemerides in Celestial
      Reference Set (CRS) format -- state vectors at regular
      intervals.  The Saturn CRS file has been converted to ASCII and
      is archived as file CRS010AA.CRS in the GEOMETRY directory.
 
      The current version of the NAIF SPK file for the Voyager Saturn
      encounter is also provided; it is in the NAIF 'transfer' format
      and is archived under the name VG1_SAT.SPK in the GEOMETRY
      directory.
 
      HGA Pointing Data - High-Gain Antenna (HGA) pointing information
      was delivered to the Voyager Radio Science Team as binary files
      on computer tape.  Seven original binary files and an equal
      number of ASCII translations are included in the GEOMETRY
      directory.  File VH014.DAT and its ASCII translation VH014T.TAB
      are assumed to be the best files for analysis, but only because
      of the apparently higher file number (records documenting the
      history of these files have been lost).
 
      POCA Data - The Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly (POCA)
      set the (tunable) local oscillator in the DSN receivers.  To
      recover Doppler shifts resulting from gravitational forces on
      the spacecraft or propagation through media with varying index
      of refraction, the receiver tuning must be known precisely.
      The VG1SPOC5.DAT file in the CALIB directory contains binary
      POCA data; file VG1SPOC6.TAB holds the same frequency data in
      an ASCII table format.  Files VG1POC1.DAT and VG1SPOC3.DAT are
      original files giving frequency of the Voyager 1 S-band carrier
      expected at DSS 63; VG1SPOC2.TAB and VG1SPOC4.TAB are the
      respective ASCII translations.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      Original files (CRS files and HGA pointing files) were defined
      using the  EME-1950 coordinates system.  NAIF files, accessed
      with NAIF Toolkit software, allow extractions of positions and
      velocities in many coordinate systems.  The basic radio data
      (ODR files) are independent of coordinate system.
 
 
    Software
    ========
      The following main programs are included in the archive.  All
      were written in FORTRAN 77; all have been tested and used on
      a Sun ULTRA-5 running Solaris 2.5.1.  The SOFTWARE directory
      includes source code for these programs (and their subroutines)
      and a Unix Makefile which can be used to generate binary

<field name="confidence_level_note"><![CDATA[Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      This is a good data set.  Known problems are minor.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was examined by a peer review panel
      prior to its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).
      The peer review was conducted in accordance with PDS
      procedures.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      This data set covers the Voyager 1 Saturn egress occultations
      (atmosphere and rings), the ring scattering experiment,
      and a post-experiment mini-ASCAL (HGA calibration) sequence.
 
      Quality issues include (1) the occasional loss of digital
      samples resulting from use of analog recording technology
      (dropouts), (2) the loss of records on a few tapes from
      deterioration of the CCT, (3) less than 8-bit accuracy in
      the analog to digital conversion, and (4) spurs and other
      anomalous signals in addition to the carrier.  Items (1)
      and (2) have been discussed above; items (3) and (4) are
      simply limitations in working at the technological
      frontier.  Note that many tapes from Recorder B suffer from
      a 'stuck' bit.  That is, rather than 8-bit sampling
      accuracy, there is only 3-bit accuracy because the fourth
      most significant bit was always ON.
 
      Buffering: There were several points where buffering of data
      (momentary storage) may be important to the user.  (1) Time
      tags in ODR data records were buffered.  The first sample
      in an ODR file was taken on an integer second, but the time
      tag is slightly (a few microseconds) earlier.  (2) The
      data samples themselves were buffered, by an amount between
      1 and 2 sample periods (less than 6 microseconds).
      (3) POCA frequencies were buffered, so that the frequency
      in the POCA file should be associated with the previous
      second.  (4) The frequency rate in the POCA was double
      buffered (offset by 2 seconds).  The POCA buffering varied
      among data acquisition systems; the amounts indicated by
      (3) and (4) are the extremes.  Users should conduct
      self-consistency checks to determine the correct POCA
      buffering correction.  The buffering determined by the
      Voyager Radio Science Team has not been recorded.
 
      Polarization: Right-circularly polarized (RCP) signals were
      transmitted from the spacecraft at both S-band and X-band.
      Both right- and left-circular polarizations (LCP) were
      captured at the ground station.  The LCP data were collected
      primarily to detect depolarized signal during the ring
      occultation and scattering phases of the observations.
      Neither transmitting nor receiving antenna was capable of
      providing purely circular polarization; the end-to-end
      cross-polarized signal was probably somewhere between 20 and
      30 dB below the same-polarized signal.  Post-experiment LCP
      signal levels (e.g., after 06:46:00) may be useful for
      determining the actual level of cross-polarization.  No
      Saturn-related cross-polarization was reported by the
      Voyager Radio Science Team.

<field name="data_set_description"><![CDATA[Data Set Overview
=================
 
 
The data from the ROSETTA PLASMA CONSORTIUM (RPC) Fluxgate
Magnetometer (MAG) was submitted by Ingo Richter (TM) for the RPCMAG
team. The PI of the team is Karl-Heinz Glassmeier.
 
Note that this is the first version archived for this dataset.
Version 1 was never archived.
 
 
The data have been measured during
 -The first Earth Flyby (EAR1) in the time period
   March 1, 2005 - March 7, 2005
     and
 -the initial Passive Checkout Phase (PC0) at
  March 29, 2005
 
 
All magnetic field data are calibrated, resampled data. That means the
data represent the 3 components of the magnetic field measured in
physical units (nT). Calibration has been applied according to the
Ground calibration results which means:
- temperature dependent offset calibration
- temperature dependent sensitivity calibration
- temperature dependent misalignment calibration
 
 
Data are given in different coordinates, dependent on the calibration
LEVEL.
 
 LEVEL_F :  averaged data in s/c-coordinates
            Source of these data are either LEVEL_B or LEVEL_K data.
 
 LEVEL_G :  averaged data in ECLIPJ2000-coordinates
            Source of these data are either LEVEL_C or LEVEL_L data.
 
 LEVEL_H :  averaged data in ECLIPJ2000-coordinates,
            Reaction wheel influence eliminated,
            Data available for disturbed times only
            Source of these data are either LEVEL_C or LEVEL_L data.
 
 LEVEL_K :  Lander heater current influence  corrected data in
            s/c-coordinates, Data available for disturbed times only
            Source of these data are LEVEL_B data.
 LEVEL_L :  Lander heater current influence  corrected data in
            ECLIPJ2000-coordinates, Data available for disturbed times
            only. Source of these data are LEVEL_C data.
 
Bad vectors have been removed. Any s/c caused residual magnetic fields
are not eliminated. The ground temperature model for the sensor
calibration has been improved (expanded for a wider temperature range
down to - 130 deg C) using long term temperature model obtained
from flight data.
The data are sorted by the sensor (OB: outboard sensor, IB: inboard
sensor)and the measurement mode (M1..M6) and average interval (A<n>,
where n denotes the average interval in seconds). Data can uniquely be
identified by their file names.
Averaging means calculating a mean value of of the specified interval
in time domain. It does not mean any mixing of data from the OB and IB
sensor.
 
Normally the OB is the Primary (Pri) and the IB is the Secondary (Sec)
sensor. However, this order can be toggled by TCs. This feature has
been tested especially and only during the commissioning phases.
 
 
In cases were the PRIMARY and SECONDARY sensor were toggled the
individual data files (OB/IB) will contain data measured with
different sampling rates according to the actual sampling rates of the
PRIMARY and SECONDARY sensors. Refer to the MODE DESCRIPTION table
below. The actual sampling rate is the only indicator showing which
sensor is the primary and which is the secondary one.
 
 
LEVEL_H data were only generated if the  signature of the Reaction
wheel rotations showed up in the calibrated data. A correction could
be achieved for only for higher frequently sampled data. For sample
rates below one Hertz the disturbing spectrum of the Reaction Wheels
can hardly be distinguished from the background spectrum. Therefore
only burst and medium mode data are corrected.

FILENAME CONVENTION & Mode Coding
===================================
Due to operational constraints it might happen that the instrument
mode or the primary sensor has to be switched during a specific
observation.
The actual mode and the primary sensor of the instrument can easily
be identified by analyzing the filename of the actual data files. The
complete filename convention is listed in the EAICD, chapter 3.1.4.
 
The filenames for RESAMPLED averaged data (CLE,CLF,CLG,CLI) are coded
as follows:
 
<inst>  <begin of observation>_<level>_<sensor>_A<average>.<ext>
RPCMAG          yymmdd           CLE      IB    A60         LBL
                                 CLF      OB                TAB
                                 CLG
                                 CLI
 
 
Example: RPCMAG040528_CLG_OB_A20.LBL
         RPCMAG040528_CLG_OB_A20.TAB
 
Average denotes the time interval for one average period in seconds.
 
 
The filenames for RESAMPLED Heater or Reaction Wheel influenced data
(CLK, CLL, CLH)  are coded as follows:
 
<inst>  <begin of observation>_<level>_<sensor>_<inst mode>.<ext>
RPCMAG         yymmddThhmm       CLK      IB      M1..M6      LBL

 =================
 
    The SP-2 experiment on Vega spacecraft was intended
    for studying the spatial and mass distributions of
    dust particles in the cometary coma over the mass
    range 1.e-16 to 1.e-6 g.  Covering such a broad mass
    range was made possible by using sensors of two
    types, namely, impact plasma and acoustic.
 
     The threshold sensitivity of the dust particle
    acoustic detector in terms of the transferred
    momentum is given by Pmin ~ 2x10**-5 gcm/s.  Taking
    into account that the recoil momentum may exceed the
    particle momentum mV by 5 to 10 times, the minimum
    mass of recorded particles is < 3x10**-13 g.  The
    measurement range n (> m)x3x10**-13 to ~ 2x10**-6 g
    is divided into 16 channels.  With the relative width
    delta/m ~ 2.82, sensitive area S = 500 cm**2,
    accumulation time for one spectrum is 1 s, which
    corresponds to the spatial resolution ~ 80 km over
    the flyby trajectory.  The counting rate of small
    mass particles is about 4095 1/s.
 
     The ionization detector is capable of recording
    particles with mass 3x10**-16 to 3x10**-11g.  The
    number of channels is 6, with relative width delta/m
    = 10, sensitive area - 40 cm**2.  The limit counting
    rate of small mass particles is ~ 65,500 1/s.  The
    accumulation time for one spectrum is 1 s.
 
     The flyby trajectories of the Vega spacecraft in the
    cometocentric frame can be specified by the
    coordinates of the closest approach to the nucleus
    R0(R0x,R0y,R0z) and the components of the relative
    velocity V(Vx,Vy,Vz).  The corresponding values for
    Vega1 and Vega2 were as follows:
 
 
    Vega 1:
    R0x = 7830 km;      R0y = 2480 km;      R0z = 3400 km;
    Vx = 28.64 km/s;    Vy = -72.73 km/s;   Vz =-12.95km/s;
 
    Vega 2:
    R0x = 7100 km;      R0y = 2680 km;      R0z = 2630 km;
    Vx = 30.53 km/s;    Vy = -69.44 km/s;   Vz =-11.88km/s;
 
 
    If the results of the dust flux measurements are
    referred to the time reckoned from the instant of
    closest approach, the corresponding distances to the
    cometary nucleus can be found as R=R0*sqrt(1 +
    (t/t0)^2), where the parameter t0 = R0/V.  In the
    course of measurements the numbers of particle
    impacts with masses exceeding the channel threshold
    is counted in each pulse height channel at 1 second
    intervals along the trajectory:
 
	 N(>m) = F(>m)*S*T = n(>m)*V*S*T,
 
    where n(>m) is the number density, F(>m)=n(>m)*V the
    cumulative flux, S the effective sensor area (500 cm2
    for the acoustic sensor and 28.57 cm2 for the impact
    plasma one), T=63/64s the accumulation time in each
    measurement.
 
     For the acoustic sensors, dead time corrections were
    introduced at channel count rate N(>m) > 50/s.  For
    the fast impact plasma sensors such corrections were
    not needed.
 
     The SP-2 data from IKI (Dyachkov) are formatted into
    table containing 2092 records.  Each record consists
    of 18 columns and contains time of measurement
    referred to one of closest approach, 5 columns of

       7) Br (radial component),
       8) Bt (tangential component),
       9) Bn (normal component),
      10) Bmag  (magnitude of the average components),
      11) avg_Bmag (average of the magnitude of the raw
          components),
      12) Lambda (longitude = tan^-1(Bt/Br)),
      13) Delta (latitude = sin^-1(Bn/avg_Bmag) ),
      14-16) rms vector (Pythagorean root mean square deviation
          of the component averages),
      17) npts (number of points in average),
      18) flag a character string which indicates software
          or s/c hardware intervention which reduces confidence
          in the data (NULL flags represent 'good' data).
 
      The Heliographic coordinate system is defined by the spacecraft
      centered R, T, N coordinates whose unit vector are:
 
      R - along the Sun-spacecraft line, positive away from the
          Sun;
      T - parallel to Sun's equator, positive in the sense of
           Jupiter's motion;
      N - equal to R x T.
 
      An ancillary data file containing the derived spacecraft
      magnetic field is provided with this data at a 48 second sample
      rate.  These data provide zero level offsets used in the data
      processing.  S/C field data is provided in spacecraft

<field name="data_set_description"><![CDATA[Data Set Overview
=================
 
The Photopolarimeter/Radiometer (PPR) subsystem is one of the four
remote sensing instruments mounted on the Galileo Orbiter scan
platform and is designed to measure the degree of linear polarization
and intensity of reflected or scattered sunlight and the intensity of
thermally emitted radiation from Jupiter and its major satellites.
Primary science objectives and anticipated results of the PPR
experiment are to: (1) determine the vertical and horizontal
distribution of cloud and haze particles in the atmosphere of Jupiter;
(2) determine the energy budget of Jupiter and the variation in the
amount and spatial distribution of reflected solar radiation and
emitted thermal radiation for Jupiter and its satellites, including
the thermal structure of the atmosphere of Jupiter; and (3) measure
and map the photometric, polarimetric, and thermal radiometric
properties of the major satellites of Jupiter.  These objectives of
course contribute to the broader goals of the Galileo Mission science
disciplines of atmospheres and satellites as planned and coordinated
by the Atmospheres Working Group (AWG) and the Satellite Working Group
(SWG).
 
With the Galileo Orbiter constrained to use the low-gain antenna, the
Jupiter Phase mission planning was necessarily predicated on the
strategy of recording most of the observations by the remote sensing
instruments during each encounter period, or Jupiter and satellite
close approach, for playback during the long cruise portions of the
eccentric orbits.  As a consequence, the key spacecraft resources for
science operations were Data Memory System (DMS) track usage, bits-to-
ground as a measure of downlink telemetry capability, and propellant
for spacecraft attitude reorientation, or science turns.  Initial
planning by the Galileo Project Science Group (PSG) thus entailed the
allocation of spacecraft resources to the three science disciplines -
atmospheres, magnetosphere, and satellites - with the respective
working groups planning and coordinating specific observations, or
Orbit Activity Plan ELements (OAPELs).  The resulting plans are
summarized in the Orbit Planning Guide (OPG; [GLLOPG]).
 
The OPG summarizes the basic science objectives for each discipline
and describes the strategies that were adopted given the resources
allocated to each WG.  For the AWG, the strategy was to focus on
integrated studies of a variety of atmospheric features and to
emphasize observations that are unique in terms of instrumental
capability or observing geometry opportunities.  For the SWG, the
objective was to obtain global coverage of the satellites at modest
spatial resolution consistent with resources and to emphasize small
regions of interest for high spatial resolution and full multispectral
coverage.  AWG and SWG objectives required coordinated observations by
two or more of the four scan platform instruments as well as some
observations by individual instruments.
 
AWG Science Objectives and Observation Strategy:
 
Atmospheric science objectives for the Galileo Mission were to: (1)
determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere; (2) determine
the structure of the atmosphere to a depth of at least 10 bars; (3)
determine the nature of the cloud particles and the location and
structure of the cloud layers; (4) determine the radiative energy
balance in the atmosphere; (5) investigate the circulation and
dynamics of the atmosphere; and (6) investigate the upper atmosphere
and ionosphere.  The Galileo Probe addressed these objectives at one
location and time, while the Orbiter observations are essential for
completing the picture by providing spatial and temporal coverage.
Observations by the remote sensing instruments on the Orbiter provide
high spatial resolution with broad spectral and phase angle coverage.
In general, coordinated observations by the scan platform instruments
are the optimum strategy because of the broad spectral coverage thus
afforded.  While many of the AWG observations were accordingly
coordinated, the planned sequences typically involved distinct OAPELs
for the individual instruments closely spaced in time rather than
actually simultaneous measurements because of practical issues of
efficient DMS tape usage.
 
Since the number of image frames from the Solid State Imaging (SSI)
system was rather restricted for the low-gain antenna mission, the AWG
emphasized the observation of discrete atmospheric features utilizing
joint remote sensing by the scan platform instruments.  So the primary
AWG observational objective was for local regions defined by spatial
scales of about 10,000 km, to determine the temperature structure,
distribution of minor gaseous constituents, properties of the clouds,
radiative energy budget, and wind field from observations at the
highest spatial resolution over a range of emission and phase angles.
These local regions included the Probe Entry Site, shearing regions at
the edges of jets, white ovals, brown 'barges', infrared 'hot spots',
and equatorial plumes.  Because of the need to obtain SSI frames
spaced appropriately in time for determining cloud motions and to
obtain a range of emission and phase angles, these observations were
called feature tracks.  Features covering a broader area are also
important, but their coverage could not involve joint observations by
all remote sensing instruments at their fullest capabilities.  These
regions included the Great Red Spot (GRS), the North and South Polar
Regions, and two stable axisymmetric features: South Tropical Zone
(STrZ) and North Equatorial Belt (NEB).  In order to establish
context, to study zonal wave structure, and to provide a modest survey
for temporal variations, global observations by individual instruments
were planned on a very limited basis.  Finally, given the limitations
of local or regional feature characterization and the relatively
modest opportunities for complete longitudinal coverage in global
maps, meridional scans were employed to provide sensitive studies of
meridional variability of temperature, composition, or cloud
properties.
 
PPR observations in support of the AWG strategy are characterized by
the following OAPEL types:
1) FTBAS:  Basic feature track support; observes the local regions in
both radiometry and photopolarimetry as part of the atmospheric
feature campaign involving all the remote sensing instruments.
2) FTPOL:  Adds feature track coverage to FTBAS in photopolarimetry at
other phase angles.
3) FTRAD:  Repeat of feature track in FTBAS in radiometry at different
emission angle.
4) REGMAP:  Characterize properties of a region larger than the
standard feature track; nominally 4 times larger in both dimensions.
5) GLOBAL:  Global map with complete coverage over 360 degrees of
longitude with variable latitude range.
6) NSSTRP:  North-south stripe provides pole-to-pole coverage at
selected longitudes, sometimes selected to pass through features
observed in feature track or regional map observations.
 
SWG Science Objectives and Observation Strategy:
 
Satellite science objectives for the Galileo Mission were to: (1)
characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the
satellite surfaces; (2) investigate the surface mineralogy of the
satellites and determine the distribution of the compositional units;
(3) determine the gravitational fields, magnetic fields, and dynamical
properties of the satellites; and (4) study satellite atmospheres and
ionospheres, extended gas clouds arising from the satellites, and
interactions with the magnetosphere.  Observations to achieve the
satellite science objectives have far less emphasis on coordinated
measurements by the scan platform instruments than that for
atmospheres, but instead are often focussed on timing of specific
observations within the context of the satellite encounter geometry.
 
Principal PPR satellite science objectives are: (1) characterizing the
nature of current Io volcanism including temporal variability; (2) the
search for possible internal activity on Europa and delineation of
Europa's surface thermophysical properties; (3) characterizing the
surface physical and optical properties with photopolarimetric phase
observations; (4) determining global surface thermophysical property
variations and surface volatile stability on Ganymede and Callisto;
and (5) obtaining absolute temperature distribution maps.  The PPR
OAPEL types employed to obtain appropriate observations to realize
these objectives are:
1) DGTM (Dayside Global Thermal Map):  Determine global daytime
brightness temperature with highest possible spatial resolution as a
function of wavelength to characterize global variations in surface
compaction, its correlation with geological unit, and its possible use
for evaluating surface ages, emplacement mechanisms, or compositions;
investigate sub-resolution temperature variations as probes of surface
roughness and local albedo distribution; and evaluate stability of
volatiles on the surface.
2) TPO (Thermal Phase Observation):  Observe the variation in
brightness temperature of a particular point on the surface when seen
from different directions to improve the determination of kinetic
surface temperatures.
3) DRKMAP (Darkside Map):  Determine global nighttime brightness
temperatures with highest possible spatial resolution as a function of
wavelength to characterize global variations in surface compaction,
its correlation with geological unit, and its possible use for
evaluating surface ages, emplacement mechanisms, or compositions and
to look for possible sources of endogenic heat for Europa.
4) HIRESS (High Resolution Samples):  Determine brightness temperature
distribution for small areas near closest approach to characterize
local variations in surface properties, evaluate stability of
volatiles on the surface, and look for possible sources of endogenic
heat for Europa.
5) PPO (Polarimetry Phase Observation):  Measure polarization of
reflected sunlight as a function of phase angle to infer grain sizes
and refractive index of surface particles.
6) IOLITE (Io Bright-Side Monitoring):  Map thermal emission as a
function of wavelength with best possible spatial resolution on
several orbits to characterize spatial distribution and temporal
variability of large, low-temperature, high power hot spots on Io's
sunlit hemisphere.
7) IOMON (Io Monitoring):  Map thermal emission as a function of
wavelength with best possible spatial resolution on several orbits to
characterize spatial distribution and temporal variability of large,
low-temperature, high power hot spots.
 
As indicated in the Orbit Planning Guide, the Galileo Orbiter Jupiter
Phase began with the approach to Jupiter and orbit insertion (JA/J0)
followed by the prime mission with a tour of eleven orbits around
Jupiter.  NASA approved the Galileo Europa Mission (GEM) to follow the
prime mission with a tour of fourteen more orbits with a focus on
Europa and concluding with two encounters of Io.  The Io encounters
were placed at the end of GEM because of the increased risk to the
spacecraft and instruments from the intense radiation expected at that
closer approach to Jupiter.  Despite some effects attributable to the
radiation, the overall Galileo Orbiter health remained quite good, and
NASA thus approved a further extended tour, the Galileo Millennium
Mission (GMM), which among a number of objectives, permitted observations
from two platforms as the Cassini spacecraft made its Jupiter
flyby in late 2000 on its way to Saturn.  The tours were shaped by
close, or targeted, encounters with Ganymede, Europa, Callisto, and
Io, with one such encounter on each orbit except numbers 5 and 13,
which were used as 'phasing orbits' with no planned encounter science
owing to the effect of Jupiter solar conjunction on telemetry.  There
were in addition to the targeted encounters, non-targeted satellite
encounters that permitted observations at intermediate ranges for a
number of the orbits.  The convention adopted for designating the tour
encounter phases covering the period of several days about the
satellite encounters and Jupiter closest approach was to use the
letter corresponding to the targeted satellite and the orbit number,
e.g., G1, E4, C10, and I24.  Based upon the allocated spacecraft
resources, the specific opportunities presented by each encounter
phase, and the observation strategies described above, the working
groups designed a detailed plan for the mission as described in the
Orbit Activity Plan [GLLOAP].
 
PPR observations in the detailed mission plan used the basic OAPEL
types described above (as well as a few special types added later),
usually in a special PPR Burst-to-Tape record format that stored the
relatively low rate (216 bps) PPR data in spacecraft memory until an
appropriately-sized block of data was accumulated to be written to the
DMS tape.  Other PPR observations were made in the so-called 'ride-
along' mode with a record format that included the PPR data as part of
the Low Rate Science along with data from the prime instrument for
that particular OAPEL, nearly always either the Near-Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer (NIMS) or SSI instruments.  For both types of PPR
observations, the original strategy was to use one of three principal
PPR operational modes: (1) cycle mode, for which the PPR filter wheel
makes a complete cycle over a period of about 28 seconds, making
photopolarimetry and thermal radiometry measurements; (2) radiometry
mode, for which the PPR filter wheel cycles back and forth over just
the 7 radiometry positions; and (3) photopolarimetry mode, for which
the PPR filter wheel makes a complete cycle, but steps through the
radiometry positions without taking any data.
 
Midway through the G1 encounter, the PPR instrument exhibited
anomalous behavior with the filter wheel becoming stuck at a single
radiometry position.  As a consequence, all planned PPR OAPELs for G2
were canceled and a sequence involving thermal cycling of the
instrument in an attempt to recover wheel stepping was added at the
end of the G2 encounter.  When that recovery attempt failed, all PPR
OAPELs in C3 and E4 were performed at the single radiometry band at
which the wheel was stuck.  Another recovery sequence at the end of
the E4 sequence proved successful and all PPR observations from then
until the end of the Jupiter Phase Nominal Mission were performed
using an operational mode that allows stepping the wheel back and
forth over a few positions, thus permitting operations without going
back to the position at which the wheel had become stuck.  This same
strategy was followed throughout GEM and GMM, but it was necessary to
have the filter wheel step through the worrisome position on several
occasions in order to start a new cycle.  In each case this operation
was successful and the filter wheel did not become stuck.  Of course,
this means that most PPR OAPELs were then made at fewer wavelengths
than originally planned.  See the INST.CAT file for a detailed
description of the PPR operational modes and the nature of the filter
wheel anomaly.
 
The observations in the present data set are the PPR Experiment Data
Record (EDR) level data for the GEM and GMM phases from E12 encounter
through I33 encounter.  The PPR EDRs include instrument housekeeping
and science data and these are presented in ASCII tabular format,
hence designated R_EDR for reformatted EDR.  Data for each PPR
observation, or OAPEL, are contained in a single data file.  File
labels specify the OAPEL, time of observation, data file format,
and contain a unique PRODUCT_NAME for the observation that is
generally the same as the Galileo observation ID with -R_EDR or -RDR
appended to indicate reformatted EDR (present data set) or reduced
data, respectively.
 
The observation ID is a 12-character field that begins with two
characters for the orbit (e.g., E4, with the letter dropped after
orbit C9), followed by one letter for the target body (J - Jupiter,
C - Callisto, E - Europa, G - Ganymede, I - Io, N - calibration
target, X - space or not applicable), followed by one letter for the
prime instrument for the OAPEL (N - NIMS, P - PPR, S - SSI, U - UVS),
followed by six characters for the observation name (usually the OAPEL
type, but also proper names or abbreviations thereof), followed by a
2-digit observation series number.  Thus, the observation IDs for the
two PPR global maps of Jupiter in orbit G1 are G1JPGLOBAL01 and
G1JPGLOBAL02, while the PPR ride-along with one of the NIMS
observations of a brown barge at 42-degree phase angle in orbit E11 is
11JNBRG04203.  An exception to the leading portion (prior to -R_EDR)
of the PRODUCT_NAME being identical to the observation ID is that we
retain the leading letter for the orbits after C9.
 
 
Parameters

The PPR presents to the Galileo Orbiter Command and Data Subsystem
(CDS), an 18-byte instrument data buffer for each 2/3-sec interval
corresponding to one minor frame (or MOD91) count of the spacecraft
clock (91 minor frames constitute one RIM count of the spacecraft
clock).  For each of the 18-byte PPR minor frame records, the first
six bytes are housekeeping data that completely specify the instrument
status, both commanded parameters and position within operational
measurement mode cycles.  The remaining twelve bytes are three sets of
PPR science data sample pairs and their associated identifying
parameters and parity check bit.
 
Because of the differences in time required for specific steps of the
instrument operation, the various operational modes of the PPR result
in the generation of the 18-byte minor frame records at variable
rates.  Those rates range from just slightly slower than that at which
the CDS performs the readout of those records every 2/3 second to a
rate that is about three times slower.  Accordingly, the PPR design
uses two internal 18-byte buffers that are alternately filled, with
one buffer being active, or in the state of being filled, and the
other containing the previous 18 bytes of housekeeping and science
data for the sequence.  At the time of each CDS readout of PPR data,
it is only the non-active buffer that is presented and placed into the
CDS processing stream, and whenever that buffer has been previously
transferred, the PPR sets a flag in the housekeeping data of that
record to indicate that it is a 'repeat' record.  For PPR observations
that use the Low Rate Science format to record to the DMS tape, all
PPR minor frame records are recorded and ultimately returned.  With
the PPR Burst-to-Tape record mode, however, the CDS checks the PPR
housekeeping to identify and discard the repeat records, storing only
the non-redundant records for playback and downlink telemetry.
 
 
Data
====
 
The PPR raw binary EDR data are reformatted into ASCII tables, i.e.,
R_EDR, with each record corresponding to the housekeeping and science
data from each PPR minor frame record returned.  Each record begins
with the spacecraft clock RIM and MOD91 counts that correspond to the
time that the respective buffer for that record was readout by the
CDS.  This is followed by housekeeping data and the three pairs of
science data samples with their identifying parameters.
 
For PPR observations that use the Burst-to-Tape record mode, the
spacecraft scan platform pointing (viz., right ascension and
declination angles) information is merged with the PPR science data
because the Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) readouts
that are included in the Low Rate Science record blocks and provide
scan platform pointing would not otherwise be available with adequate
frequency in the playback and downlink of the Burst-to-Tape mode.  So
the last two columns of the R_EDR records are scan platform right
ascension and declination angles, which are set to zero when the PPR
observation uses the Low Rate Science record mode.  In all record
formats other than PPR Burst-to-Tape, the AACS information is
delivered directly to the SPICE System, which provides general target
and observing geometry and is archived in PDS.  For the Burst-to-Tape
record mode, the scan platform right ascension and declination are
obtained from the PPR science data and then delivered to the SPICE
System.
 
Note also that in the PPR Burst-to-Tape record mode, the second byte
of the PPR housekeeping is deleted from the data stored in the CDS
memory buffer in order to reduce the total data volume slightly and to
optimize the sizing of the buffer.  The second byte of housekeeping
was chosen because the bits therein correspond to the values for three
parameters: photopolarimetry gain, radiometry gain, and number of
samples, and all three of these parameters are set by command and do
not change during instrument operation unless reset by sending a new
command.  For the present R_EDR data set, the values for these three
parameters are set to default values of 0, 0, and 1, respectively, to
reflect the omitted byte in the actual EDR data returned.  See the
data label file format for a detailed description of these parameters.
When the EDR data are processed to generate reduced science data, the
known values for these parameters are manually input based upon the
Galileo Sequence of Events File (SEF), which indicates the timing of
the PPR commands and the commanded parameter values.
 
Listed below by orbit are the PPR R_EDR data files with the data
filename, observation ID (modified as described above), observation
start time, and duration. Files are located in subdirectories by orbit
name and then by target.

Ancillary Data
==============
 
The housekeeping and science data in the full PPR minor frame records
contain all of the commanded parameters and all variable parameter
values that completely specify the instrument status, including the
position within various measurement mode cycles.  When observations
are made using the PPR Burst-to-Tape record mode, the second byte of
the PPR housekeeping is deleted before the data are stored in the CDS
memory buffer.  This byte contains the commanded values for the
photopolarimetry gain, radiometry gain, and number of successive
samples to be taken at each filter wheel position before stepping to
the next position.  These three parameters are set by command and do
not change during instrument operation unless reset by a new command.
The current data set uses default values of 0, 0, and 1, respectively,
for these parameters for observations using the Burst-to-Tape mode.
Actual values can be obtained from the Galileo Sequence of Events File
(SEF), which is archived in the PDS by the Galileo Project and which
indicates timing of the PPR commands and the commanded parameter
values.  When the EDR data are processed to generate reduced science
data, the SEF or equivalent PPR-team-maintained command records are
used to manually input the actual values for these three parameters.
 
The target body for each observation is indicated in the observation
ID and in the label file for each data file.  Observed location on the
target body and observing geometry (viz., target range and incidence,
emission, and phase angles) for each measurement sample within an
observation sequence must be obtained from the SPICE system for the
spacecraft clock time corresponding to the measurement.  Note that the
spacecraft clock RIM and MOD91 counts for each record of the current
R_EDR data set correspond to the time that the respective PPR memory
buffer was readout by the CDS.  The actual time at which the
measurement samples were acquired is earlier than that time by varying
amounts depending on instrument operation mode and the position of the
data sample in the PPR buffer.  When the EDR data are processed to
generate reduced science data, the appropriate adjusted spacecraft
clock time is determined and included as part of each measurement
sample record in that data set.  The SPICE data (kernels) and system
tools are archived in PDS by the Galileo Project.
 
 
Coordinate System
=================
 
For PPR observations that use the Burst-to-Tape record mode, the right
ascension and declination angles of the scan platform instrument
boresight direction are merged with the PPR housekeeping and science
data and appear as the last two columns of each R_EDR data set record.
All other record modes include the scan platform pointing in the AACS
section of the Low Rate Science blocks, so it is necessary to use the
SPICE system to obtain these angles for those observations.  The SPICE
system kernels contain Galileo spacecraft ephemeris, scan platform
pointing, and instrument data necessary for providing target body
coordinates and observing geometry as a function of time, using IAU
standard coordinate systems as specified in the SPICE documentation.
 
 
Software
========
 
PPR R_EDR files are tables of ASCII format fields for each of the PPR
housekeeping and science data elements.  This simple conversion from
the raw, binary EDR records involves no irreversible change or data
reduction.  As such, the R_EDR data set represents an appropriate
primary archive of all of the raw PPR data delivered to the ground and
there is no expectation of any need for reprocessing to perform this
conversion in the future.  Accordingly, the software used to read the
raw, binary EDR files and create the R_EDR data is not archived with
this data set.]]></field>

=========================
 
The PPR R_EDR data set represents all PPR data from the Jupiter Phase
Nominal Mission and GEM and GMM extended tours as recovered from the
Galileo Project ground system. When multiple passes of the DMS tape were
downlinked, the data were merged to provide the most complete sequences.
 
 
Data Coverage and Quality
=========================
 
The R_EDR data set is organized into a separate file for each PPR
observation or OAPEL as listed in the Data section under DATA_SET_DESC
above.  The start times and durations in that set of lists correspond
to the actual times of the first and last records returned for the
particular OAPEL rather than the planned times, if different.  In a
few cases, the data begin later or end earlier than planned owing to
limitations on DMS tape or bits-to-ground capability or losses during
downlink and ground processing.  There are, in addition, a few OAPELs
that have coverage gaps.
 
Parity bits generated by the PPR instrument processor and placed in
the PPR housekeeping and science data were monitored in the processing
of the EDR data and indicate that there appear to be no instances of
individual bit changes in the data stream.  For PPR observations that
use a DMS tape record mode employing the Low Rate Science format, any
data gaps caused by telemetry dropouts appear as a loss of entire PPR
minor frame records.  In contrast, for the Burst-to-Tape record mode,
the channelization procedure used in storing the PPR data stream in
the CDS memory buffer can lead to the return of PPR minor frame
records with missing bytes in which zero-fill is used by the ground
system.  The PPR science data samples use a non-zero 'dark' level
offset larger than any expected noise.  Thus, zero is not a legitimate
value for these samples, for which the PPR processor uses a twos-
complement mode that when converted from the raw data stream to the
R_EDR format will appear as 4095 if zero-fill has occurred.
 
 
Limitations
===========
 
As described in the Data Set Overview section of DATA_SET_DESC above,
the PPR instrument exhibited anomalous behavior with the filter wheel
becoming stuck at a single radiometry position midway through the G1
encounter.  While a recovery sequence involving thermal cycling of the
instrument succeeded at the end of the E4 encounter, an operational
mode different from that originally planned was then used during the
remainder of the Jupiter Phase Nominal Mission and the GEM and GMM
extended tours to avoid having to step through the position at which
the filter wheel stuck more than on a limited number of occasions.
As a consequence, many planned OAPELs were used with a somewhat
different science strategy than that originally intended and some
OAPEL names may seem slightly inconsistent with the actual observation.
It should be noted that during encounter C20, the PPR exhibited quite
anomalous behavior in radiometry measurements.  All of the radiometry
data samples were clustered at a DN value of 1412, slightly above the
typical dark-level offset, and showed an extremely small scatter well
below the typical noise level.  This behavior was interpreted as being
consistent with a failed radiometry detector or pre-amplifier.  A PPR
heating sequence was thus scheduled early in encounter C21 based upon
the hope that one possible cause, debonding in the detector, might be
at least partially reversed by high temperatures.  Data playback from
C21 (and all subsequent encounters) showed that the radiometry function
had essentially recovered to nominal performance.]]></field>

    =================
 
      This data set contains Raw data taken by New Horizons
        Student Dust Counter
      instrument during the JUPITER mission phase.
 
      For the Jupiter encounter mission phase, SDC collected no
      science data during the Jupiter flyby, as the requisite
      spacecraft configuration prevented SDC from operating.  There
      were some very sparse data taken from December, 2006 through
      April, 2007, and some of very short (or zero) duration after the
      Jupiter flyby from April, 2007 through June, 2007.
 
      Note that some SDC data files have the same stop and start time
      and a zero exposure time.  The reason for this is that the start
      and stop time for SDC data files are the event times for the
      first and last events in the files, so for files that contain a
      single event, these two values are identical.
 
      Every observation provided in this data set was taken as a part of a
      particular sequence.  A list of these sequences follows:
 
      Sequence IDs & start times (end times are the start times
      of the following Sequence IDs) for the SDC instrument
      during the JUPITER phase of the New Horizons Mission
      =========================================================
 
      Sequence ID:  JESD_PLACEHOLDER
      Start UTC:    2007-01-01T00:00:00
      Start SCLK:   1/0029915517:30912
      Description:  The SDC instrument did not have any sequenced data taken
                    during Jupiter encounter.  This entry is only a
                    placeholder to cover any data that exist.
 
      For the list of observations and their parameters, refer to
      the data set index table (typically INDEX.TAB & CUMINDEX.TAB,
      initially in the /INDEX/ area of the data set).
 
 
    Time
    ====
 
      There are several time systems, or units, in use in this dataset:
      New Horizons spacecraft MET (Mission Event Time or Mission Elapsed
      Time), UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), and TDB Barycentric
      Dynamical Time.
 
      This section will give a summary description of the relationship
      between these time systems.  For a complete explanation of these
      time systems the reader is referred to the documentation
      distributed with the NAIF/SPICE toolkit from the NAIF PDS node.
 
      The most common time unit associated with the data is is the
      spacecraft MET.  MET is a 32-bit counter on the New Horizons
      spacecraft that runs at a rate of about one increment per second
      starting from a value of zero at
 
        19.January, 2006 18:08:02 UTC
 
      or
 
        JD2453755.256337 TDB.
 
      The leapsecond adjustment (DELTA_ET = ET - UTC) over this dataset
      is 65.184s.
 
      The data labels for any given product in this dataset usually
      contain at least one pair of common UTC and MET representations
      of the time at the middle of the observation.  Other portions
      of the products, for example tables of data taken over periods
      of up to a day or more, will only have the MET time associated
      with a given row of the table.
 
      For the data user's use in interpreting these times, a reasonable
      approximation (+/- 1s) of the conversion between Julian Day (TDB)
      and MET is as follows:
 
        JD TDB = 2453755.256337 + ( MET / 86399.9998693 )
 
      For more accurate calculations the reader is referred to the
      NAIF/SPICE documentation as mentioned above.
 
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      The data in this data set were created by a software data
      processing pipeline on the Science Operation Center (SOC) at
      the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI), Department of Space Studies.
      This SOC pipeline assembled data as FITS files from raw telemetry
      packets sent down by the spacecraft and populated the data labels
      with housekeeping and engineering values, and computed geometry
      parameters using SPICE kernels. The pipeline did not resample
      the data.
 
 
    Data
    ====
 
      The observations in this data set are stored in data files using
      standard Flexible Image Transport Sytem (FITS) format.  Each FITS
      file has a corresponding detached PDS label file, named according
      to a common convention.  The FITS files have image and/or table
      extensions; see the PDS label plus the DOCUMENT files for a
      description of these extensions and their contents.

      Visit Description, Visit Number, and Target in the Data Labels
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
 
        The observation sequences were defined in Science Activity
        Planning (SAP) documents, and grouped by Visit Description and
        Visit Number.  The SAPs are spreadsheets with one Visit Description
        & Number per row.  A nominal target is also included on each row
        and included in the data labels, but does not always match with the
        TARGET_NAME field's value in the data labels.  In some cases, the
        target was designated as RA,DEC pointing values in the form
        ``RADEC=123.45,-12.34'' indicating Right Ascension and Declination,
        in degrees, of the target from the spacecraft in the Earth
        Equatorial J2000 inertial reference frame.  This indicates either
        that the target was either a star, or that the target's ephemeris
        was not loaded into the spacecraft's attitude and control system
        which in turn meant the spacecraft could not be pointed at the
        target by a body identifier and an inertial pointing value had to
        be specified as Right Ascension and Declination values.  The PDS
        standards do not allow putting a value like RADEC=... in the PDS
        TARGET_NAME keyword's value; in those cases the PDS TARGET_NAME
        value is set to CALIBRATION.
 
 
      Unresolved Liens on the Data
      ----------------------------
 
        None exist at the present time.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      The geometry items included in the data labels were computed
      using the SPICE kernels archived in the New Horizons SPICE
      data set, NH-X-SPICE-6-JUPITER-V1.0.
 
 
    Reference Frame
    ===============
 
 
      Geometric Parameter Reference Frame
      -----------------------------------
        Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EMEJ2000) is the
        inertial reference frame used to specify observational geometry
        items provided in the data labels.  Geometric parameters are based
        on best available SPICE data at time of data creation.
 
 
      Epoch of Geometric Parameters
      -----------------------------
        All geometric parameters provided in the data labels were
        computed at the epoch midway between the START_TIME and
        STOP_TIME label fields.
 
 
 
    Software
    ========
 
      The observations in this data set are in standard FITS format
      with PDS labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided
      and commercial programs. For this reason no special software is
      provided with this data set.

      During the processing of the data in preparation for

      observation were used only if they passed a rigorous verification
      process including standard checksums.
 
      In addition, raw (Level 2) observation data for which adequate
      contemporary housekeeping and other ancillary data are not available
      are not reduced to calibrated (Level 3) data.  This issue is raised
      here to explain why some data products in the raw data set,

    Review
    ======
      The data have been reviewed and validated by the instrument team
      members, as well as by SOC personnel.
 
 
    SDC updates for Data Sets V2.0
    ==============================
 
 
      None of the formats for the Calibrated data will change.  The data
      file will look the same, including the data formats.  The changes
      are improvements to the processing code.  There were 3 changes made
      to the code:
 
 
      Change to dust impact velocity assumption
      -----------------------------------------
 
        An assumption is needed for the the dust impact velocity to
        calculate its mass.  Before this update the pipeline used only the
        normal component of the total velocity between the dust and
        instrument (assuming the particle is in Keplerian orbit).
        Now this has been changed to the total relative velocity of the
        particle (still assumed to be in Keplerian orbit) and the
        instrument.
 
 
      Using multiple sensors for temperature correction
      -------------------------------------------------
 
        There are two thermistors on the analog board.  The analog board
        temperature is used for calibrating a particular channel on the
        board.  Before this update, for a given channel the temperature
        of the closest thermistor to a that channel.  Now a linear fit
        to the temperatures is used.
 
 
      New charge-velocity-mass calibration curve
      ------------------------------------------
 
        The calibrated data contains the mass of the particle.  The
        charge to mass curve used to be
 
          Q=3.18E17*m^1.3*v^3.0
 
        where m is the mass, Q is the charge and v is the relative speed.
        This was the Simpson-Tuzzolino curve.  The new curve is a function
        of detector temperature as well:
 
          Q=(1.15E15+6.75E12*T)*m^1.052*v^2.883
 
        where T is the temperature.  A paper with this new calibration
        curve will  be submitted for publication in Spring, 2009.]]></field>

    =================
      This data set contains Voyager 1 and 2 measurements of the
      brightness of Saturn at H Lyman alpha and in the H2 Lyman and
      Werner bands shortward of H Lyman alpha.  Pointing has been
      corrected by the C-Smithing process, and these data were derived
      from the pre-encounter North-South Map sequences.  In this
      sequence, the UVS field of view was located near the central
      meridian of the planet.  The field of view stepped slowly from
      north to south, and then rapidly repositioned to the north.
      These scans were repeated until all longitudes had been sampled.
      Coverage in longitude was nearly continuous in time.  There were
      short breaks for observations of satellites.
 
      The brightnesses represent integrals over the appropriate
      passband that have been computed from the full spectrum.  The
      spectra were binned by Flight Data System (FDS) count, so that
      each record contains the data from one 48-second frame.
      Because the motion of the scan platform was synchronized with
      FDS count, each record corresponds to a single pointing
      position on Saturn.  The first two spectra of each FDS count
      have been excluded, because the scan platform was moving during
      those times.  In some cases (e.g.  during the flyback slews to
      prepare for another N/S scan) all spectra were flagged with bad
      pointing status, and no spectra appear in the output bin.  The
      data in each time bin was normalized by dividing by the number
      of spectra binned, so that the spectra represent counts per
      3.84 second interval (the integration time in the GS-3 data
      mode used for most of the encounter sequences).  The final
      processing step in the spectral analysis stage was a correction
      for fixed pattern noise (flat fielding).
 
      The brightnesses were computed by summing over the appropriate
      wavelength channels.  These are:
 
                             Voyager 1
          Emission          channel range      wavelength range (A)
            H2 bands          43 - 58             924 - 1072
            H Lyman alpha     70 - 78            1174 - 1257
 
                             Voyager 2
          Emission          channel range      wavelength range (A)
            H2 bands          45 - 60             921 - 1069
            H Lyman alpha     72 - 80            1171 - 1254
 
      The brightnesses were corrected for dark counts, which arise
      mainly from the radiation environment.  Because the
      radiation-induced dark count rate depends rather sensitively on
      the magnetic latitude of the spacecraft, and hence on time,
      this correction is made on a spectrum-by-spectrum basis.  For
      the H Lyman alpha emission, the procedure also compensates
      approximately for H2 band emissions that fall within the H
      Lyman alpha channel range.  This correction procedure consists
      of subtracting the sum over suitably chosen background
      channels.  These background channels are:
 
                             Voyager 1
          Emission          channel range      wavelength range (A)
            H2 bands          23 - 38             739 -  887
            H Lyman alpha     58 - 66            1063 - 1146
 
                             Voyager 2
          Emission          channel range      wavelength range (A)
            H2 bands          25 - 40             736 -  884
            H Lyman alpha     60 - 68            1060 - 1143
 
      Each record contains pointing information that consists of the
      latitude and SLS longitude of the two ends of the slit (P2
      and P8 points) and the center of the slit (P5 point) projected
      on Saturn.  In addition, each point has associated with it a
      status flag.  A minus (-) means that the line of sight for the
      specified point intersects the planet.  A plus (+) means that
      the line of sight is off the planet.  In the latter case, the
      latitude and longitude refer to the point on the planet that is
      under the point of closest approach to the planet of the line
      of sight.
 
      Each logical record corresponds to one FDS count, and consists
      of three lines in the data file.  The quantities on each line
      are:
 
          first line:  Spacecraft Event Time, FDS count, S/C to
                       Saturn range.
 
         second line:  P2 latitude, P2 longitude, P5 latitude,
                       P5 longitude, P8 latitude, P8 longitude,
                       P2 status, P5 status, P8 status
 
          third line:  H Lyman alpha counts, H2 band counts.

      Bad spectra resulting from telemetry noise and other effects
      have been omitted from this data set.  Spectra acquired when
      the scan platform was in motion have also been omitted to
      reduce spatial smearing as much as possible.  Some spatial
      smearing due to s/c limit cycle motions is unavoidable.
 
      The pointing information for the data set was derived by the
      C-Smithing (image navigation) process at JPL.  A short period
      at the beginning of the observation (FDSC 43945:33 to 43952:39)
      was not included in the C-Smithing process and we have filled

      For the list of observations and their parameters, refer to
      the data set index table (typically INDEX.TAB & CUMINDEX.TAB,
      initially in the /INDEX/ area of the data set).
 
 
    Time
    ====
 
      There are several time systems, or units, in use in this dataset:
      New Horizons spacecraft MET (Mission Event Time or Mission Elapsed
      Time), UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), and TDB Barycentric
      Dynamical Time.
 
      This section will give a summary description of the relationship
      between these time systems.  For a complete explanation of these
      time systems the reader is referred to the documentation
      distributed with the NAIF/SPICE toolkit from the NAIF PDS node.
 
      The most common time unit associated with the data is is the
      spacecraft MET.  MET is a 32-bit counter on the New Horizons
      spacecraft that runs at a rate of about one increment per second
      starting from a value of zero at
 
        19.January, 2006 18:08:02 UTC
 
      or
 
        JD2453755.256337 TDB.
 
      The leapsecond adjustment (DELTA_ET = ET - UTC) over this dataset
      is 65.184s.
 
      The data labels for any given product in this dataset usually
      contain at least one pair of common UTC and MET representations
      of the time at the middle of the observation.  Other portions
      of the products, for example tables of data taken over periods
      of up to a day or more, will only have the MET time associated
      with a given row of the table.
 
      For the data user's use in interpreting these times, a reasonable
      approximation (+/- 1s) of the conversion between Julian Day (TDB)
      and MET is as follows:
 
        JD TDB = 2453755.256337 + ( MET / 86399.9998693 )
 
      For more accurate calculations the reader is referred to the
      NAIF/SPICE documentation as mentioned above.
 
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      The data in this data set were created by a software data
      processing pipeline on the Science Operation Center (SOC) at
      the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI), Department of Space Studies.
      This SOC pipeline assembled data as FITS files from raw telemetry
      packets sent down by the spacecraft and populated the data labels
      with housekeeping and engineering values, and computed geometry
      parameters using SPICE kernels. The pipeline did not resample
      the data.
 
 
    Data

      The observations in this data set are stored in data files using
      standard Flexible Image Transport Sytem (FITS) format.  Each FITS
      file has a corresponding detached PDS label file, named according
      to a common convention.  The FITS files have image and/or table
      extensions; see the PDS label plus the DOCUMENT files for a
      description of these extensions and their contents.

      Visit Description, Visit Number, and Target in the Data Labels
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
 
        The observation sequences were defined in Science Activity
        Planning (SAP) documents, and grouped by Visit Description and
        Visit Number.  The SAPs are spreadsheets with one Visit Description
        & Number per row.  A nominal target is also included on each row
        and included in the data labels, but does not always match with the
        TARGET_NAME field's value in the data labels.  In some cases, the
        target was designated as RA,DEC pointing values in the form
        ``RADEC=123.45,-12.34'' indicating Right Ascension and Declination,
        in degrees, of the target from the spacecraft in the Earth
        Equatorial J2000 inertial reference frame.  This indicates either
        that the target was either a star, or that the target's ephemeris
        was not loaded into the spacecraft's attitude and control system
        which in turn meant the spacecraft could not be pointed at the
        target by a body identifier and an inertial pointing value had to
        be specified as Right Ascension and Declination values.  The PDS
        standards do not allow putting a value like RADEC=... in the PDS
        TARGET_NAME keyword's value; in those cases the PDS TARGET_NAME
        value is set to CALIBRATION.

    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      The geometry items included in the data labels were computed
      using the SPICE kernels archived in the New Horizons SPICE
      data set, NH-X-SPICE-6-LAUNCH-V1.0.

        Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EMEJ2000) is the
        inertial reference frame used to specify observational geometry
        items provided in the data labels.  Geometric parameters are based
        on best available SPICE data at time of data creation.
 
 
      Epoch of Geometric Parameters
      -----------------------------
        All geometric parameters provided in the data labels were
        computed at the epoch midway between the START_TIME and
        STOP_TIME label fields.

<field name="data_set_description"><![CDATA[Data Set Overview
  =================
    The MIPLRAD method refers to radiometric correction systematically
    performed by MIPL (OPGS at JPL) to meet tactical time constraints
    imposed by rover planners, since these RDRs are integrated into
    terrain mesh products used for traverse planning. The method can
    apply to any of the camera instruments.
 
    In the operations environment for the Prime and Extended Missions,
    MIPL's radiometrically-corrected RDR filename carries the product
    type designator of RAD for the non-linearized case and RAL for
    the linearized case. However, in the PDS archive volume, the MIPL
    radiometrically-corrected RDR carries the product type MRD for the
    non-linearized case and MRL for the linearized case. Though there
    is no difference in image content between the operational and
    archived versions of MIPL's radiometrically-corrected RDR, the
    distinction in their filenames is made to identify all RAD and
    RAL product types in the PDS archive volumes as being unique to
    the Athena Pancam team's radiance correction process.
 
    As a special note, two bugs pertaining to MIPL's radiometric
    correction process were discovered during the preparation of data
    for PDS archival, which was after the MER Prime Mission and well
    into the Extended Mission. The problems involved on-board flat-field
    removal and temperature determination. For the purposes of this
    discussion, the term MIPLRAD refers to the original implementation
    used during Prime Mission and approximately through the first two
    months of Extended Mission, while MIPLRAD2 represents the corrected
    implementation used thereafter. Both MIPLRAD and MIPLRAD2 are valid
    values for RADIOMETRIC_CORRECTION_TYPE. The differences are
    described below. Note that all RAD/RAL/RSD/RSL types of RDRs have
    been reprocessed with MIPLRAD2, limiting the number of
    MIPLRAD-processed products in the PDS archive volume to a subset of
    mosaics which were generated before MIPLRAD2 was implemented. Note
    also that no mosaics were generated from on-board flat-field images
    using MIPLRAD, so the only difference in the archive data is the
    temperature issue.
 
    MIPLRAD is a first-order correction only and should be considered
    approximate. MIPLRAD first backs out any onboard flat field that was
    performed. It then applies the following corrections: flat field,
    exposure time, temperature-compensated responsivity. The result is
    calibrated to physical units for MER of W/m^2/nm/sr. The actual
    algorithm and equations used for MIPLRAD are shown below. Each
    correction is applied in sequence, to every pixel:
 
    1. If on-board flat-fielding has been applied, it is backed out
       according to the parameters in FLAT_FIELD_CORRECTION_PARM, which
       defines ff(x,y). MIPLRAD incorrectly multiplied by ff(x,y) rather
       than divided, causing the on-board flat field to be doubled
       rather than removed. MIPLRAD2 correctly divides by ff(x,y) as
       follows:
 
       output(x,y) = input(x,y) / ff(x,y)
 
    2. For the flat-field adjustment, the x and y coordinates are
       adjusted based on downsampling and subframing to find the
       corresponding pixel in the flat field, then the DN is divided by
       the flat field value:
 
       output(x,y) = input(x,y) / flat_field(x',y')
 
    3. Exposure time is then removed. Exposure time comes from
       EXPOSURE_DURATION, converted to seconds:
 
       output(x,y) = input(x,y) / exposure_time
 
    4. The temperature responsivity is removed next. The temperature
       comes from the first element of INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE and the
       parameters R0, R1, and R2 come from the flat field parameter
       file, and are different per instrument. The actual temperature
       formula is as follows:
 
       output(x,y) = input(x,y) * (R0 + R1*temp + R2*temp*temp)
 
    For MIPLRAD, the temperature is simply the first element of
    INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE. For MIPLRAD2, the temperature is dependent
    on the instrument. The temperature used for each instrument is
    determined using the following general rules
    (from the MER thermal team):
 
    a) Use the CCD temp of said camera, if it exists.
 
    b) Use the CCD temp of neighboring camera (left/right partner), if
       available.
 
    c) Use the CCD temp of similar camera (i.e., Navcam/Pancam).
 
    d) Use CCD temperature from any camera.
 
    e) Use the electronics temperature of said camera.
 
    f) Use the electronics temperature of similar camera.
 
    Rules e and f are a last resort in view of the fact that MER
    operates warmup heaters inside the electronics (during nighttime and
    early morning) that raise camera electronics temperatures above CCD
    temperatures. Thus any CCD temperature is at higher priority than
    any electronics temperature measurement. The most significant
    consequence of this is that the MI CCD is the best available proxy
    for all four Hazcam CCDs. A value of 0.0 is ignored as a no-reading
    value, and a value greater than or equal to 50.0 (degrees C) is
    interpreted as a broken sensor. Either value causes that temperature
    to be ignored and the next one on the list tested. If none of the
    values is valid, a default of 0.0 degrees C is used.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    MER Camera Payload RDRs are considered Level 3 (Calibrated Data
    equivalent to NASA Level 1-A), Level 4 (Resampled Data
    equivalent to NASA Level 1-B), or Level 5 (Derived Data
    equivalent to NASA Level 1-C, 2 or 3). The RDRs are to be
    reconstructed from Level 2 edited data, and are to be assembled
    into complete images that may include radiometric and/or geometric
    correction.
 
    MER Camera Payload EDRs and RDRs will be generated by JPL's
    Multimission Image Processing Laboratory (MIPL) under the OPGS
    subsystem of the MER GDS. RDRs will also be generated by the Athena
    Pancam Science and Microscopic Imager Science Teams under the SOAS
    subsystem of the GDS.
 
    RDR data products will be generated by, but not limited to, MIPL
    using the Mars Suite of VICAR image processing software at JPL, the
    Athena Pancam Science Team using IDL software at Cornell University
    and JPL, and the Microscopic Imager Science Team using ISIS software
    at USGS (Flagstaff) and JPL. The RDRs produced will be processed
    data. The input will be one or more Camera EDR or RDR data products
    and the output will be formatted according to this SIS. Additional
    meta-data may be added by the software to the PDS label.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    RDR products generated by MIPL will have a VICAR label wrapped by a
    PDS label, and their structure can include the optional EOL label
    after the binary data. RDR products not generated by MIPL may
    contain only a PDS label. Or, RDR products conforming to a standard
    other than PDS, such as JPEG compressed or certain Terrain products,
    are acceptable without a PDS header during mission operations, but
    may not be archivable.
 
    The RDR data product is comprised of radiometrically decalibrated
    and/or camera model corrected and/or geometrically altered versions
    of the raw camera data, in both single and multi-frame (mosaic)
    form. Most RDR data products will have PDS labels, or if generated
    by MIPL (OPGS), dual PDS/VICAR labels. Non-labeled RDRs include JPEG
    compressed products and the Terrain products.
 
    The MIPLRAD method is a radiometric correction performed by MIPL
    (OPGS) at JPL. It can apply to any of the camera instruments, but
    only the RAD (and RAL) type is generated. MIPLRAD first backs
    out any onboard flat field that was performed. It then applies the
    following corrections: flat field, exposure time,
    temperature-compensated responsivity. The result is calibrated to
    physical units for MER of W/m^2/nm/sr. MIPLRAD is a first-order
    correction only and should be considered approximate.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The MIPL Mars Program Suite was used to generate these RDRs.

  =================
    This data set contains the polarimetry of asteroid 25143 Itokawa
    published in Cellino et al. (2005).  The observations were made
    from  June 26 through July 3, 2004 with the Torino
    photopolarimeter at the 2.15 m telescope of the El Leoncito
    Observatory in Argentina.  On June 26 and July 1 and 2, weather
    prevented any useful observations of Itokawa, so the data
    presented here are from the other nights of the run.  The degree
    of linear polarization in five filters (Johnson-Cousins UBVRI) was
    measured over a wide range of phase angles, between 40 and 80
    degrees.  The data obtained are sufficient to derive an estimate
    of the asteroid's geometric albedo of 0.24 +/- 0.01.
 
    The single entries in the table correspond to averages over time
    spans of about one hour each. Some averaging was done because in
    polarimetry single measurements have usually fairly large error
    bars.  During one hour the phase angle did not change by more than
    one degree, as can be seen from the difference in the phase angle
    listed in each entry of the table for the same night.
 
    Single polarization measurements consisted of eight photometric
    measurements corresponding to a cycle of eight different positions
    of the half-wave plate in front of the polarimeter. A single cycle
    takes about 3.5 minutes. For Itokawa it was decided that the usual
    procedure of computing the average nightly polarization, by making
    an average over all the single measurements taken during the
    night, was clearly not appropriate.  The reason for not doing so
    was that the object was moving fast and the phase angle was
    changing. On the other hand, the phase change was fairly small
    over intervals of some tens of minutes.
 
    The average over the cycles continuously executed during time
    spans of about one hour was adopted as a compromise between the
    need of documenting the change in polarization for changing phase
    angle, and the need of having fairly good error bars in the
    corresponding polarization measurements.
 
    25143 Itokawa is an S-type asteroid, an NEO, and was the target of
    the Hayabusa mission.

<field name="data_set_description"><![CDATA[Data Set Overview
        =================
        This data set is intended to include all groundbased asteroid radar
        detections.  These entries were collected by Steven J. Ostro, and
        selected data have been collected from the published
        literature.  Scientific questions about this data set should be
        directed to Steven J. Ostro, JPL, at the email address
        ostro@echo.jpl.nasa.gov.  (Effective date for this address:
        March 17, 2003.)
 
        Modification History
        ====================
        The radar data set was first introduced into PDS at the April 1994
        asteroid data sets review, and has been updated yearly since that
        time.  Updates consist in adding entries for asteroid radar
        detections made since the previous update and adding full data for
        detections which have been published since the last update.  The
        1997 update added radar albedos, and these have continued to be
        added in subsequent updates.
 
        Parameters
        ==========
        An entry for each detection reports radar cross-section, circular
        polarization and radar albedo, if known, error values for these
        parameters, year of observation, and the reference in which the
        observations were reported.
 
        Data
        ====
        This data set comprises a single data table, 'radar.tab',
        tabulating the parameters listed above.
 
        Ancillary Data
        ==============
        The references of the papers in which the asteroid radar detections
        were reported are compiled in the file 'radarref.tab'.]]></field>

        original reference for each entry.
 
        Review
        ======
        This data set underwent external peer review on May 29, 2003.
 
        Data Coverage and Quality
        =========================
        This data set is intended to include all groundbased radar
        detections of asteroids.  It is complete through December 31,
        2002.  If an item of data is missing from the table (appearing as
        a null value such as 9.99), this indicates that the data item is
        not available from the published paper.  For example, for
        monostatic radar observations, circular polarization ratio cannot
        be derived, so it is left blank.  In some cases, the data provided
        in the paper are too complex to be presented in the table, as in
        the case of a time-series of values.  In case of questions, the
        original papers should be consulted.
 
        Limitations
        ===========
        This data set is intended to collect the data reported in the
        published literature, as well as to record the existence of
        unpublished asteroid radar detections.]]></field>

<field name="data_set_description"><![CDATA[Data Set Overview
  =================
 
    This archive contains DEMs acquired in September 2003 by the Wallops/
    GSFC Airborne Topographic Mapper, a scanning laser altimeter. The data
    were acquired at three locations in Nevada: Sedan crater, in the
    northern part of Yucca Flats, Schooner crater, in the northwestern part
    of the Nevada Test Site, and Buckboard mesa (Danny Boy crater), in the
    western part of the Nevada Test Site.
 
    The data consist of three vector data files and three DEM flat files,
    each with an accompanying detached PDS label. The three DEM flat files
    also have detached ENVI headers containing geographic data. The vector
    files list the longitude in degrees, the latititude in degrees, and the
    elevation in meters above datum as floating point values. The vector
    data were rasterized with ENVI to 2x2 m spacing and projected to UTM
    coordinates. In the resultant DEM flat files, the pixels are floating
    point values in meters above the datum.
 
    For the vector data:
      horizontal datum = WGS84 Ellipsoid
      vertical datum = ITRF94
    For the raster data:
      horizontal datum = WGS84 Ellipsoid
      vertical datum = NAD27
 
    All three datasets were generated from multiple flight lines.

Mission Phase Definition
========================
Mission phase abbreviations are defined in CATALOG/MISSION.CAT and
DOCUMENT/ESA_DOC/RO_EST_TN_3372.PDF.
 
 
 
Data files
==========
          Data files are:
 
          The tracking files from Deep Space Network (DSN) and from
          the Intermediate Frequency Modulation System (IFMS) used by
          the ESA ground station New Norcia. Level 1A to level 2 data
          are archived. The predicted and reconstructed Doppler and
          range files Geometry files.
 
          All Level 1A binary data files will have the file name
          extension eee = .DAT
          IFMS Level 1A ASCII data files will have the file name
          extension eee = .RAW
          Level 1B and 2 tabulated ASCII data files will have the file
          name extension eee = .TAB
          Binary data files will have the file name extension .DAT
 
     Data levels
     ----------
         It should be noted that these data levels which are also used
         in the file names and data directories are PSA data levels
         whereas in the PDS label files CODMAC levels are used.
 
          PSA data level | CODMAC level
          -----------------------------
               1A        |      1
               1B        |      2
               2         |      3
 
    Data Set Identifier
    -------------------
          The 'DATA_SET_ID' is a unique alphanumeric identifier for
          the data sets.
 
          It looks something like:
 
                      XX-Y-ZZZ-U-VVV-NNNN-WWW
 
         Acronym |    Description          | Example

        ---------------------------------------------------------
          WWW    | Version number          | V1.0
 
        RSI data were originally archived as volumes rather than data
        sets. However, ESA PSA does not use volume but data set.
        To avoid confusion it was specified that one RSI data volume
        is equal one data set. Thus the data set was also assigned a
        4 digit sequence number which is identical to the one used in
        the Radio Science VOLUME_ID. If the data_set_id is known it is
        automatically specified on which volume the data set is found.
 
    VOLUME_ID
    ---------
        The VOLUME_ID is a unique alphanumeric identifier for volume.
        The VOLUME_ID provides a unique identifier for a single
        RSI data volume, including a complete measurement
        The Volume ID is formed using a mission identifier, an
        instrument identifier of  3 characters, followed by an
        underscore character, followed by a 4-digit sequence number.
        In the 4-digit number, the first one represents the
        volume set, the remaining digits define the range of volumes
        in the volume set. For Mars Express the first digit is not
        defined after the kind of measurement (see below for Rosetta
        and VEX), but after the Mission phase.
 
        0000: Commissioning
        1000: Occultation
        2000: Gravity
        3000: Solar Conjunction
        4000: Bistatic Radar
        5000: Passive/Active Checkouts
        6000: Swing-bys/Fly-bys
        7000: Cometary Coma Observations
 
          It looks something like:
 
                           XXXXX-ZZZZ
 
             Acronym | Description                       | Example
         ----------------------------------------------------------
             XXXXX   | Instrument Host and Instrument ID | RORSI
         ----------------------------------------------------------
              ZZZZ   | 4 digit sequence number           | 0123
 
Important note: the here defined ESA PSA Volume_Id is not identical
with the Radio Science Volume_Id. The Radio Science Volume_Id is a
number which is incremented measurement by measurement, independent
what kind of measurement was conducted. The Radio Science Volume_Id
belonging to one single measurement can be find in the Logbook, loca-
ted in the folder DOCUMENT/RSI_DOC.
 
 
    Descriptive files
    -----------------
          Descriptive files contain information in order to support
          the processing and analysis of data files. The following
          file types are defined as descriptive files with extension
          eee =
         .LBL  PDS label files
         .CFG  IFMS configuration
         .AUX  Ancillary files (event files, attitude files,
               ESOC orbit files, products, SPICE files)
         .TXT   Information (text) files
 
 
File naming convention
======================
 
      All incoming data files will be renamed and all processed data
      files will be named after the following file naming convention
      format. The original file name of the incoming tracking data
      files will be stored in the according label file as
      source_product_id.
      The new PDS compliant file name will be the following:
 
                     rggttttlll_sss_yydddhhmm_qq.eee

    Processing (DSN)
    ================
      TNF's are screened for 'bad' data points by the JPL Radio Metric
      Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT) before the files are processed to
      ODF's. The TNF's included in this archive, however, are the pre-
      screened versions.
 
      The open-loop (RSR) data in the archive have been assembled from
      individual records (packets) into files. They have not
      otherwise been processed.
 
      The Level 2 radio occultation data have been processed as
      follows.
 
        The RSR samples were digitally filtered to reduce bandwidth;
        in the process they were also converted from 16-bit I and
        16-bit Q complex integer samples to 64-bit I and 64-bit Q
        double precision complex floating point samples.  The complex
        floating point samples were Fourier transformed and estimates
        made of the carrier amplitude and frequency and their uncer-
        tainties.
 
        The reconstructed spacecraft trajectory, planetary epheme-
        redes, records of uplink and downlink tuning, and other data
        were used to calculate the expected carrier frequency at the
        receiving antenna.
 
        The Level 2 products are tables of the observed amplitude, its
        uncertainty, the observed frequency, its uncertainty, and the
        difference between the observed and the expected frequency as
        a function of time.  Separate tables have been created for
        each RSR.
 
      The Level 2 bistatic radar spectra (SPC) have been processed as
      follows.
 
        The RSR samples were converted from 16-bit I and 16-bit Q
        complex integer samples to 64-bit I and 64-bit Q double
        precision complex floating point samples.  In the process they
        were digitally corrected for non-uniform spectral response of
        the receiving system.  This was done by computing spectra from
        series of time samples and dividing each spectrum by the
        square root of a power spectrum computed from many minutes of
        noise.  The amplitude of the samples was then adjusted so that
        power spectra in each receiver channel would have an amplitude
        proportional to kTsysB where k is Boltzmann's constant, Tsys
        is the receiver system temperature in Kelvin, and  B  is the
        width of one frequency bin (spectral resolution) in the power
        spectrum.
 
        Then the power spectra (e.g., XR*conj(XR)) and cross spectra
        (e.g., XR*conj(XL)) were computed.

      Files in the DATA Directory
      ---------------------------
 
      Files in the DATA directory are:
 
      Data Level 1A:
      --------------
 
      Level 1A data are incoming raw tracking data files obtained
      either from ESA IFMS or DSN. All incoming data files will be
      renamed after the file naming convention format defined in
      section 5.1 of the RSI File Naming Convention document
      [RSIFNC2004] and get a minimal detached label file .LBL. The
      original file name of the incoming tracking data files will be
      stored in the according label file as SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID. These
      files have the file extension .RAW if ASCII and .DAT if binary
      files.
 
      TNF's are screened for 'bad' data points by the JPL Radio Metric
      Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT) before the files are processed to
      ODF's. The TNF's included in this archive, however, are the pre-
      screened versions.
 
        Tracking and Navigation Files (TNF Directory)
        ---------------------------------------------
        TNF's became available within a few hours of the completion of
        a Rosetta pass.
 
        Orbit Data Files
        ----------------
        ODF's were typically issued daily throughout the RO mission
        with weekend data being consolidated into a single file on
        Monday. Typical ODF's have sizes 15-50 kB.
        Sample rates typically are 1/sec or 1/(60 sec).
 
        Radio Science Receiver Files (RSR Directory)
        --------------------------------------------
        Each RSR generated a stream of packets which could be
        assembled into files of arbitrary length.  It was decided,
        after some experimentation, that files containing about 300 MB
        were the largest that could be easily manipulated in the
        analysis computers available in 2003.  With a small number of
        exceptions, this is the largest file size that will be found
        in the RSR directory.
 
 
      The open-loop (RSR) data in the archive have been assembled from
      individual records (packets) into files.  They have not other-
      wise been processed.
 
      IFMS Data Level 1B:
      -------------------
 
      Level 1B files are created from level 1A (raw tracking data) as
      edited ASCII formatted file.
 
      Three files are generated for each ESA IFMS Level 1A data file:
            Level 1B IFMS data file (extension .TAB)
            Level 1B IFMS configuration file (extension .CFG)
            Level 1B IFMS label file (extension .LBL)
      The label file contains the description of the .TAB as well as
      of the .CFG file.
 
      Up to eight files are generated for each DSN ODF Level 1A file:
            Level 1B ODF Doppler S-Band data file + label file
            Level 1B ODF Doppler X-Band data file + label file
            Level 1B ODF Ranging S-Band data file + label file
            Level 1B ODF Ranging X-Band data file + label file
 
      Cologne is processing IFMS and ODF data, Stanford University
      processes RSR data up to level 2 and forwards raw and processed
      data to Cologne for archiving. However, for RSR there will be no
      level 1B files.
 
      Data Level 2:
      -------------
 
      Level 2 data are calibrated data after further processing. The
      file format is in ASCII. This data level can be used for further
      scientific interpretation. The keyword OBSERVATION_TYPE in the
      Level 2 data labels indicates which kind of measurement was
      done. Keyword values are: Occultation, Target Gravity, Global
      Gravity, Solar Conjunction, Bistatic Radar, Commissioning and
      Steins/Lutetia Flyby. Commissioning measurements were carried
      out on several days during the cruise phases. These are
      measurements where the equipment on board the spacecraft and on
      the ground station was tested.
 
      IFMS Level 2 input files:
      -------------------------
            There may be several Doppler 1 X-Band files in level 1A
            which will be merged on level 2. The same is true for all
            other Doppler file type and Ranging X and S-Band files.
            Only files with continuous sequenced numbers (the file
            names are the same only the sequence number varies for
            these files) are merged together. Otherwise a new Level
            02 data file is created (merging data files with a new
            sequence of files).
            The level 2 source_product_id however gives the RAW IFMS
            file names since the raw files are used for processing.
            But the content of the IFMS raw files are identical to the
            corresponding level 1A IFMS files in one data set, only
            the file name is different. And the source_product_id of
            the level 1A files gives the original raw IFMS files. In
            addition the level 1A files have almost the same file name
            as the corresponding level 2 files.
            The corresponding level 1A files can be found in
            DATA/LEVEL1A/CLOSED_LOOP/IFMS/DP1 for Doppler 1 files
            DATA/LEVEL1A/CLOSED_LOOP/IFMS/DP2 for Doppler 2 files
            DATA/LEVEL1A/CLOSED_LOOP/IFMS/RNG for Ranging files
 
            ----------------------------------------------------------
            Example:
            R32ICL1L02_D1X_040931103_00.TAB
            is a level 2 Doppler 1 X-Band file
 
            in R32ICL1L02_D1X_040931103_00.LBL
            the following SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID is given:
 
            SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID = {NN11_ROSE_2004_093_OP_D1_110358_0000,
                                 NN11_ROSE_2004_093_OP_D1_110358_0001,
                                 NN11_ROSE_2004_093_OP_D1_110358_0002}
 
            which are the raw IFMS files.
            The corresponding Level 1A files can be found in
            DATA/LEVEL1A/CLOSED_LOOP/IFMS/DP1
 
            Their names are:
            R32ICL1L1A_D1X_040931103_00.RAW
            R32ICL1L1A_D1X_040931103_01.RAW
            R32ICL1L1A_D1X_040931103_02.RAW
 
            and the corresponding label files give the
            source_product_id as:
 
            in the R32ICL1L1A_D1X_040931103_00.LBL file the
            source_product_id is given as:
            SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID  = NN11_ROSE_2004_093_OP_D1_110358_0000
 
            in the R32ICL1L1A_D1X_040931103_01.LBL file the
            source_product_id is given as:
            SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID  = NN11_ROSE_2004_093_OP_D1_110358_0001
 
            in the R32ICL1L1A_D1X_040931103_02.LBL file the
            source_product_id is given as:
            SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID  = NN11_ROSE_2004_093_OP_D1_110358_0002
 
            Note that in this example the three level 1A files were
            merged to one level 2 files.
            The file names of the level 1A files are almost identical
            to the level 2 file name with three differences:
            - L1A instead of L02 in the file name which tells the user
            that these are level 1A and level 2 files.
            - The two digit-sequence number at the end of the file can
            be different.
            - The level 1A files have file extension .RAW whereas
            level 2 files have file extension .TAB
            ----------------------------------------------------------
 
            Other inputs for Doppler and Ranging files:
            -------------------------------------------
            predicted orbit file (see EXTRAS/ANCILLARY/UNI_BW)
            Meteorological file (see CALIB/CLOSED_LOOP/IFMS/MET)
            AGC file (see DATA/1A or 1B/CLOSED_LOOP/AGC1 or AGC2)
            Spacecraft orbit SPICE kernels (see EXTRAS/ANCILLARY/SPICE
            can also be downloaded from
            ftp://ssols01.esac.esa.int/pub/data/SPICE/ROSETTA/kernels)
 
            Calibration Documentation:
            --------------------------
            For documentation about Doppler and Ranging Calibration
            please see in DOCUMENT/RSI_DOC/ROS_RSI_IGM_DS_3118 and
            ROS_RSI_IGM_DS_3119.
 
            For differential Doppler:
            -------------------------
            If the processed level 2 file is for example Doppler 1
            X-Band then information from IFMS raw Doppler 1 S-Band
            files which cover approximately the same time were used
            for processing as well.
            For Doppler 1 S-Band information from IFMS raw Doppler 1
            X-Band files were used.
            Doppler 2 files were processed accordingly.
            In most cases on IFMS1 and IFMS2 X-Band data were
            recorded:
            The corresponding raw files' names start with NN11_ or
            NN12_. S-Band data were in most cases recorded at IFMS3.
            The corresponding raw files' names start with NN13_.
            If for some reason this configuration was changed this is
            indicated either at the beginning of this description or
            at the end in the anomaly report.
 
            For Ranging in addition are used:
            ---------------------------------
            Range calibration file (see CALIB/CLOSED_LOOP/IFMS/RCL)
            Klobuchar coefficients for Earth-Ionosphere calibration
            (can be downloaded from this site:
             http://www.aiub.unibe.ch/download/CODE/)
 
            The calibrated Doppler files contain observed IFMS sky
            frequency,
            X-band Doppler and S-band Doppler frequency shift,
            residual (computed using the predict file), and the
            differential Doppler.
            If only a single downlink frequency was used, a differen-
            tial Doppler cannot be computed and was set to -999.999999
            in the output file.
 
            The level 2 ranging files contain the observed TWLT at
            X-band or S-band, the calibrated TWLT at X-band or S-band,
            the TWLT delay at X-band or S-band and the differential
            TWLT. If only one frequency was used, the differential
            TWLT is set to -99999.9.
 
 
      IFMS Level 2 output files:
      --------------------------
            Level 2 IFMS data file (extension .TAB)
            Level 2 IFMS label file (extension .LBL)
            Level 2 IFMS log file (extension .LOG).
 
            The log files can be found in
            /EXTRAS/ANCILLARY/RSI/LOGFILES and contain information
            about the level 2 Doppler and Ranging data processing.
 
      ODF Level 2 input files:
      ------------------------
            ODF Level 1B files
            Doppler and Range prediction file
        or
            Orbit reconstructed file
            Media calibration files
 
            The calibrated Doppler files contain observed IFMS Doppler
            expressed as X-band Doppler or S-band Doppler, residual
            and detrended X-band or S-band Doppler (computed using the
            predict file), the detrended differential Doppler. If only
            one single frequency was used, the differential Doppler
            will be set to -999.999999.
 
            The level 2 ranging file contains the observed Two-Way-
            Light-Time (TWLT) at X-band or S-band, the calibrated TWLT
            at X-band or S-band, the TWLT delay at X-band or S-band
            and the differential TWLT. If only one frequency was used,
            the differential TWLT is set to -99999.9.

     RSR Level 2 data:
     -----------------
        There are four types of 'calibrated' data in the data set;
        each is described briefly below.
 
        Surface Reflection Filter Files
        -------------------------------
        SRF files contain power spectra derived from noise measure-
        ments when the radio system was stable and there were no
        spacecraft signals in the passband.  SRF's were derived sepa-
        rately for each receiver channel; but the fact that the
        spectral characteristics of each receiver depended almost
        entirely on digital signal processing meant that there was
        little practical difference among channels when sampling
        rates (output bandwidths) were the same and the SRF's were
        interchangeable. SRF's were ASCII PDS SPECTRUM objects with
        attached labels.
 
 
        Level 2 Neutral Atmosphere Files
        --------------------------------
        L2N files were the calibrated output of partial processing of
        RSR data collected for radio occultations. They were ASCII
        tables of frequencies and amplitudes in physically meaningful
        units. Separate L2N files were derived for each receiver
        channel. The Level 2 radio occultation data have been
        processed as follows:
 
        The RSR samples were digitally filtered to reduce bandwidth;
        in the process they were also converted from 16-bit I and
        16-bit Q complex integer samples to 64-bit I and 64-bit Q
        double precision complex floating point samples.  The complex
        floating point samples were Fourier transformed and estimates
        made of the carrier amplitude and frequency and their
        uncertainties.
 
        The reconstructed spacecraft trajectory, planetary epheme-
        redes, records of uplink and downlink tuning, and other data
        were used to calculate the expected carrier frequency at the
        receiving antenna.
 
        The Level 2 products are tables of the observed amplitude, its
        uncertainty, the observed frequency, its uncertainty, and the
        difference between the observed and the expected frequency as
        a function of time.  Separate tables have been created for
        each RSR.
 
        Bistatic Radar Spectra
        ------------------------------
        SPC files were the calibrated output of partial processing of
        RSR data collected for bistatic radar.  They were ASCII tables
        of power and cross-voltage spectra.  All spectra for a single
        observation were collected in a single ASCII file.
 
        The Level 2 bistatic radar spectra (BSR) have been processed
        as follows:
 
        The RSR samples were converted from 16-bit I and 16-bit Q
        complex integer samples to 64-bit I and 64-bit Q double
        precision complex floating point samples.  In the process they
        were digitally corrected for non-uniform spectral response of
        the receiving system.  This was done by computing spectra from
        series of time samples and dividing each spectrum by the
        square root of a power spectrum computed from many minutes of
        noise. The amplitude of the samples was then adjusted so that
        power spectra in each receiver channel would have an amplitude
        proportional to kTsysB where k is Boltzmann's constant, Tsys
        is the receiver system temperature in Kelvin, and B is the
        width of one frequency bin (spectral resolution) in the power
        spectrum.
 
        Then the power spectra (e.g., XR*conj(XR)) and cross spectra
        (e.g., XR*conj(XL)) were computed.

                                 wrong and corrected uplink frequency
                                 and their corresponding files.
 
 
      Files in the CALIB Directory
      ----------------------------
 
      Files in the CALIB directory are:
 
      Calibration data files have in principle the same structure as
      normal data files. But they do not contain scientific data but
      rather reflect the behaviour of the system. These kind of data
      is typically recorded at New Norcia once for every tracking
      before the real measurement took place. For example: range
      calibration data contain the equipment propagation delay
      measurements before the tracking pass.
 
      Note: If the uplink frequency in one of the .RAW files was
      identified as wrong the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be
      generated. It tells the user which files were affected and where
      to find the corrected Level 2 data files.
 
 
      Closed loop IFMS Calib data level 1A:
      -------------------------------------
 
      These Level 1A data are incoming raw tracking data files
      obtained from ESA IFMS. All incoming data files will be renamed
      after the file naming convention format defined in section 5.1
      of the RSI File Naming Convention document [RSIFNC2004] and
      get a minimal detached label file .LBL. The original file name
      of the incoming tracking data files will be stored in the
      according label file as SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID. These files have the
      file extension .RAW.
 
 
      Closed loop IFMS Calib data level 1B:
      -------------------------------------
 
      IFMS Calib level 1B files are processed from level 1A (raw
      tracking data) into an edited ASCII formatted file.
      Three files are generated for each ESA IFMS Level 1A data file:
            Level 1B IFMS data file (extension .TAB)
            Level 1B IFMS configuration file (extension .CFG)
            Level 1B IFMS label file (extension .LBL)
      The label file contains the description of the .TAB as well as
      of the .CFG file.
 
 
      DSN METEO Files (MET directory)
      -------------------------------
        DSN METEO files were produced by the Tracking System
        Analytic Calibration (TSAC) Group at JPL.  Files give weather
        calibration information for DSN complexes. These are ASCII
        files of variable length records.  Each record is delimited
        by an ASCII line-feed <LF> (ASCII 10). METEO files were
        typically released weekly and contain all weather data for the
        complex since 1 January.  Each METEO file is accompanied by a
        PDS label. The files grow at the rate of approximately 90 kB
        per month.
 
       DSN Ionosphere Calibration Files (ION Directory)
       ------------------------------------------------
       Ionosphere Calibration files were produced by the Tracking
       System Analytic Calibration (TSAC) Group at JPL. They docu-
       mented and predicted Earth ionospheric conditions. Global
       Ionosphere Map (GIM) software created daily maps from Global
       Positioning System (GPS) data. Each day, a final map was
       created for the UT day three days previously and a preliminary
       map was created for the UT day immediately before.
       Also created were predict maps a couple times a week by
       averaging recent 'normal' days. Then the software evaluated the
       maps at the spacecraft line-of-sight and fitted the results to
       a normalized polynomial versus time over each spacecraft pass.
       This was done for all three modes: final, preliminary, and
       predict. Then the software selected the best available cali-
       bration for each pass (in priority order final > preliminary >
       predict).  An operator ran a plotting program to view all of
       the calibrations and overrode the default selections where
       desired. The mapping technique is described by
       [MANNUCCIETAL1998].
 
       They are ASCII files of variable length records. Each record is
       delimited by an ASCII carriage-return line-feed pair <CR><LF>
       (ASCII 13 followed by ASCII 10). ION files were usually
       released at one week intervals to cover a single month; only
       final files covering a full month are included in this archive.
       Each ION file is accompanied by a PDS minimal label. Typical
       file sizes are approximately 50 kB.
 
        Troposphere Calibration Files (TRO Directory)
        ---------------------------------------------
        Troposphere Calibration files were produced by the Tracking
        System Analytic Calibration (TSAC) Group at JPL. They docu-
        mented and predicted Earth tropospheric conditions and were
        based on measurements made using Global Positioning System
        (GPS) satellites. These are ASCII files of variable length
        records. Each record is delimited by an ASCII line-feed <LF>
        (ASCII 10).
 
        Surface Reflection Filter Files (SRF Directory)
        -----------------------------------------------
        SRF files contain power spectra derived from noise measure-
        ments when the radio system was stable and there were no
        spacecraft signals in the passband. SRF's were derived sepa-
        rately for each receiver channel; but the fact that the
        spectral characteristics of each receiver depended almost
        entirely on digital signal processing meant that there was
        little practical difference among channels when sampling rates
        (output bandwidths) were the same and the SRF's were inter-
        changeable. SRF's were ASCII PDS SPECTRUM objects with
        attached labels.
 
        System Temperature Calibration Files (BCAL directory)
        -----------------------------------------------------
        This table contains system temperature calibration results
        from Rosetta (RO) bistatic radar experiments. For each
        receiver channel the table includes the best estimate of
        system temperature with the antenna pointed to zenith (either
        pre- or post-cal, or a combination of both), the associated
        noise diode temperature, and the system temperature at the
        mid-point of the bistatic (surface) observation.
        In general there is one set of four rows for each experiment -
        one for each receiver channel (X-band and S-band, right- and
        left-circular polarization). The table is cumulative, growing
        by four rows for each new observation. The Bistatic Radar
        Calibration Log is produced by the Stanford University Element
        (SUE) of the Rosetta Radio Science Team under the direction of
        R.A. Simpson.
 
 
 
Browse Files (BROWSE Directory)
===============================
        Browse files may be composite PostScript files summarizing
        quick-look processing of raw RSR data. In that case each file
        has a name: rggttttL1A_BRO_yydddhhmm_00.AUX. Each file has a
        JPEG version with the same file name but extension .LBL. Both
        files are accompanied by a single detached label of the same
        file name but extension .LBL. Each PostScript file is sized to
        fit on a single 8-1/2x11 inch page. Each landscape format page
        includes four panels showing a histogram of raw data (12-bit)
        samples (upper left), one-minute average power spectra derived
        from the raw samples (upper right), one-second averages of raw
        sample power versus time (lower left), and an extract of the
        first few lines of the source RSR PDS label (lower right).
        BRO files may be helpful in quickly scanning data to determine
        which files are suitable for closer study.
 
        IFMS Browse plot files are only available as JPEG files.
        These plots are generated in order to check data quality of
        IFMS Level 2 closed-loop data. The name of the files are the
        same like the Level 2 data files except for the data type
        identifier which is set as sss=B1X,B1S,B2X,B2S if the source
        of the plots is a Doppler 1 X-Band, Doppler 1 S-Band, Doppler
        2 X-Band or Doppler 2 S-Band file, and the extension will be
        .JPG.
 
 
Geometry information - Coordinate System
========================================
 
   The geometry items SC_SUN_POSITION_VECTOR, SC_TARGET_POSITION_
   VECTOR and SC_TARGET_VELOCITY_VECTOR provided in the label of the
   data products are calculated from the spacecraft to the sun center
   expressed in J2000 reference frame, corrected for light time and
   stellar abberation.
 
   SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE are given in the
   PLANETOCENTRIC coordinate system. These parameters are computed
   for the time given in POSITION_TIME. Distances are given in km,
   angles in degrees.
 
   More information can be found in the geometry_index file under
   INDEX/. Documentation is available in the RSI document folder.
 
 
Ancillary Data
==============
      An extensive set of ancillary files is needed for proper
      analysis and interpretation of the radio data. These are
      organized in parallel directories and stored approximately
      chronologically. When a file type is not represented on an
      electronic volume, the corresponding directory has been omitted.
 
      Files in the EXTRAS/ANCILLARY Directory
      ---------------------------------------
 
      Files in the EXTRAS/ANCILLARY directory are:
 
      ESOC:   Relevant DDS files to describe the observation geometry
      SPICE:  Relevant SPICE Kernels to describe the observation geo-
              metry
      UNI_BW: Relevant PREDICT files from the Uni BW Munich
      RSI:    Level 2 processing log files
      SUE:    Ancillary files coming from Stanford University
       |-SPICE:
              Spice Kernels were produced by the RO Flight Dynamics
              Team, converted to IEEE binary format, and then distri-
              buted by the JPL Navigation and Ancillary Information
              Facility (NAIF). For more information on NAIF and SPICE
              see http://pds-naif.jpl.nasa.gov/
 
             The original Spice Kernels were merged with the JPL DE405
             planetary ephemeris and the ephemeredes of Phobos and
             Deimos for the same time interval.
      DSN:    Ancillary files provided by Deep Space Network
       |-EOP: Earth Orientation Parameter Files
       |      Earth Orientation Parameter files were produced by the
       |      Time and Earth Motion Precision Observation (TEMPO)
       |      Group at JPL. They documented and predicted Earth rota-
       |      tion (rate and axis). These are ASCII files of variable
       |      length records. Each record is delimited by an ASCII
       |      line-feed <LF> (ASCII 10).
       |      There are both 'long' and 'short' versions. The long
       |      file covered past motion since about 1962 and a predic-
       |      tion for about three months into the future; these files
       |      have typical sizes of 1 MB.
       |      The short file covered the most recent nine months of
       |      past motion and a prediction for three months into the
       |      future; these files are typically 30 kB. Each EOP file
       |      is accompanied by a PDS minimal label.
       |
       |-OPT: Orbit Propagation and Timing Geometry File
       |      Orbit Propagation and Time Generation files contain
       |      estimates of event timing (e.g., equator crossings) that
       |      depend on precise knowledge of the spacecraft orbit.
       |      These are ASCII files of variable length records. Each
       |      record is delimited by an ASCII carriage-return <CR>
       |      (ASCII 13) line-feed <LF> (ASCII 10) pair. File names
       |      have the form ydddeeeC.OPT where the file name compo-
       |      nents are the same as for BCK files (above).
       |      Each OPT file is accompanied by a PDS minimal label with
       |      file name ydddeeeC.LBL. Typical files are based on
       |      reconstructed spacecraft trajectories, cover a month of
       |      operation, and have sizes less than 500 kB.
       |
       |-LIT: Light Time File
       |      Light Time files give radio propagation time from the
       |      spacecraft to Earth as a function of time. These are
       |      ASCII files of fixed length records. Each record is
       |      delimited by an ASCII carriage-return line-feed pair.
       |      File names have the form  ydddeeeC.LIT  where the file
       |      name components are the same as for DKF files.  An LIT
       |      file may cover more than 365 days; so eee may be a year
       |      or more after yddd. Each LIT file is accompanied by a
       |      PDS label. Typical file sizes are less than 1 MB.
 
 
 
Software
========
      Software for parsing, reducing, and analyzing data such as
      these has been developed at University of Cologne and Stanford
      University.
      Because such software must usually operate at the bit-level and
      is written for a narrow range of platforms, it is not suitable
      for general distribution. No software is included with this
      archival data set.
 
 
 
Documents
=========
 
     The DOCUMENT directory contains the files that provide documen-
     tation and supplementary information to assist in understanding
     and using the data products on the volume.
 
The files evolved as the mission progressed; users should refer to the
files on the most recent (highest numbered) archive volume for the
most up-to-date information.
 
The below mentioned documents represent the maximum of available docu-
ments, but need not to be present for every measurement. For IFMS
(NNO) measurements, please refer mainly to RSI_DOC, for DSN measure-
ments to DSN_DOC.

More general description of radio science data
==============================================
 
 Closed-loop and Open-loop data:
================================
      There are in principle two different ways to record radio
      science data: Open-loop and closed-loop data.
 
      The CLOSED-LOOP system used a phase-lock loop in the receiver to
      track the downlink signal, reporting both amplitude and fre-
      quency at rates typically of 1-10 times per second.
 
      In the OPEN-LOOP system, the signal was simply converted to a
      baseband frequency range; the entire passband was sampled and
      recorded for later processing. Typical open-loop sampling rates
      for MEX were 2000 complex samples per second.
 
      CLOSED-LOOP data are efficient for characterizing slowly
      changing signals; OPEN-LOOP data (because of their much higher
      volume) are usually used when the signal is very dynamic - such
      as during an occultation or bistatic radar measurement.
 
      The data set includes four primary data types with respect to
      the two different ground station systems. These systems are on
      the one hand the ESA ground station in New Norcia, Australia
      (NNO) and the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).
 
CLOSED-LOOP data types:
     |
     |- ESA: Intermediate Frequency Modulation System (IFMS)
     |       Closed-Loop (CL)
     |
     |             In this data set file names of data recorded at the
     |             New Norcia IFMS closed loop system start with the
     |             string 'R32_ICL'
     |
     |             IFMS CL consists of Doppler and Ranging data at
     |             selected sample rates. The sample rate is usually
     |             1/s.
     |             The only exception are occultation data where the
     |             sample rate should be 10/s to get a good enough
     |             vertical resolution of the atmosphere.
     |             Ranging are only recorded for gravity measurements.
     |
     |             Thus the IFMS closed loop has three recording
     |             systems IFMS 1, IFMS 2 and IFMS 3
     |             The standard_data_product_id in the data label
     |             specifies on which system the data was recorded.
     |
     |             RSI measurements are usually done in TWO-WAY
     |             configuration: that is an uplink signal goes up
     |             (This is usually X-Band but the uplink signal can
     |             also be S-Band) and the ground station receives a
     |             dual frequency simultaneous and coherent downlink
     |             signal.
     |
     |             IFMS 1 is configured for the uplink signal. It
     |             receives X-Band downlink if uplink was X-Band and
     |             S-Band downlink if uplink was S-Band.
     |             IFMS 2 acts at backup.
     |             IFMS 3 records the second downlink signal. This is
     |             usually S-Band. But can also be X-Band when the
     |             uplink was S-Band.
     |
     |                 IFMS 1 D1 is fixed to a sample rate of 1/s
     |                 IFMS 1 D2 is on fixed to a sample rate of 1/10s
     |
     |             In addition each Doppler recording system has also
     |             two Doppler channels which can record simultaneous-
     |             ly and act as an additional backup system.
     |             Therefore for each IFMS system there should be at a
     |             given time two Doppler files and two Auto Gain
     |             Control files recorded. The file names of these
     |             data contain the string '_D1' or '_D2' for Doppler
     |             and '_G1' or '_G2' for Auto Gain control files and
     |             they will be on different subfolders within the
     |             data directory. See further down the description of
     |             the DATA Directory.
     |
     |             For these data files only X-Band ranging was
     |             possible. Ranging data was nominally recorded on
     |             IFMS1.
     |
     |-  DSN:
          |-Tracking and Navigation File (TNF)
          |
          | The Tracking and Navigation File (TNF) is the primary out-
          | put from the DSN closed-loop receiver system.  These are
          | large files, accumulating at the rate of approximately 3
          | megabytes (MB) per hour of antenna operation. The files
          | comprise nearly 20 block types, each designed to carry
          | data of interest to a particular navigation, telecommuni-
          | cations, or science community.
          | The blocks are described by TNF_SIS.TXT in the
          | DOCUMENT/DSN_DOC directory. Fields include:
          |      Uplink and downlink antenna numbers
          |      Spacecraft number
          |      Equipment identifiers, status flags, and calibration
          |      values
          |      Time tags and frequency bands
          |      Transmitted and received phase and frequency
          |      Transmitted and received ranging information
          |      Noise levels, signal-to-noise ratios, and uncertain-
          |      ties
          |
          |-Orbit Data Files (ODF)
          |
          | For many applications the TNF is too cumbersome. The ODF
          | is an edited and partially processed version of the TNF.
          | It is a smaller file, often issued in daily increments of
          | about 0.2 MB. It contains the most important information
          | (range and Doppler)
          | needed by spacecraft navigators and investigators
          | interested in determining gravitational fields of bodies
          | such as Mars. Each ODF is accompanied by a full PDS label
          | which describes both the content and format of the
          | associated file. ODF data fields include:
          | Narrowband spacecraft VLBI, Doppler mode (cycles)
          | Narrowband spacecraft VLBI, phase mode (cycles)
          | Narrowband quasar VLBI, Doppler mode (cycles)

          |      units)
          | RE(GSTDN) range (nanoseconds)

Open- Loop data types:
     |
     |-ESA: Intermediate Frequency Modulation System (IFMS) Open-Loop
     |       (OL)
     |
     |    During the commissioning phase the IFMS Open-Loop
     |    recording system was not implemented, yet.
     |
     |-DSN: Radio- Science Receiver (RSR)
     |
     |      The Radio Science Receiver (RSR) is a computer-
     |      controlled open loop receiver that digitally records a
     |      spacecraft signal through the use of an analog to
     |      digital converter (ADC) and up to four digital filter
     |      sub-channels.  The digital samples from each
     |      sub-channel are stored to disk in one second records
     |      in real time. In near real time the one second records
     |      are partitioned and formatted into a sequence of RSR
     |      Standard Format Data Units (SFDUs) which are
     |      transmitted to the Advanced Multi-Mission Operations
     |      System (AMMOS) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
     |      Included in each RSR SFDU are the ancillary data
     |      necessary to reconstruct the signal represented by the
     |      recorded data samples.
     |
     |      Each SFDU is defined here as a single row in a
     |      PDS TABLE object; later SFDUs are later rows.  The
     |      first fields in each row contain the ancillary data
     |      (time tags and frequency estimates, for example) that
     |      applied while the samples at the end of the record
     |      were being collected. The object definitions below
     |      explain where the fields are and what the contents
     |      represent.
     |
     |      Analysis of variations in the amplitude, frequency,
     |      and phase of the recorded signals provides information
     |      on the ring structure, atmospheric density, magnetic
     |      field, and charged particle environment of planets
     |      which occult the spacecraft. Variations in the
     |      recorded signal can also be used for detection of
     |      gravitational waves.
     |
     |      DSN open-loop receivers sample a narrow part of the micro-
     |      wave spectrum near the spacecraft transmitting frequency.
     |      For radio occultation tests, two RSR's were used - one
     |      each for X-RCP and S-RCP with output sampled at rates of
     |      2000 (complex; 16-bit I, 16-bit Q).
     |      The data were examined for compliance with data acquisi-
     |      tion procedures and to measure the frequency/stability of
     |      the radiolink. Four RSR's (X-RCP, S-RCP, X-LCP, and S-LCP)
     |      each sample at a rate of 25000 (complex; 16-bit I,
     |      16-bit Q) to test bistatic radar data acquisition.
     |
     |     Header information accompanying each RSR record included:
     |
     |     Date and time of the first data sample
     |     Sample rate and channel assignments
     |     Receiver local oscillator phase and frequency
     |     Attenuator settings
     |     RMS voltages at several stages in the receiving chain

      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,
      as appropriate.
 
      ODR files on the electronic media were checked using Stanford
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the
      original files.

Radio Science Validation Process
--------------------------------
      Several Quick-Look-plots of the retrieved data are generated
      during processing to Level 2. These plots are investigated to
      validate the measurement. Possible decisions are then to deliver
      the data to the official PSA Archive, to archive the data only
      internally or regard the measurement as failed.
      The following section gives a short description of the
      Quick-Look-Plots and their meaning for the validation process.
      The plots can be found in the BROWSE folder. For more details
      refer to BROWINFO.TXT, also located in this folder. For the
      respective terms refer to the document
      MEX-MRS-IGM-DS-3035/ROS-RSI-IGM-DS-3118/VEX-VRA-IGM-IS-3011
      (Doppler Processing and Calibration Software) in the DOCUMENT
      folder of this dataset.
 
Residuals
---------
      The residual (frequencyobserved - frequencypredicted) should
      fluctuate around 0 Hz with a maximum fluctuation range of
      approximately 0.1 HZ. Steps, peaks or a gradient in the residual
      should be investigated to decide if the data can be used. But it
      depends on the individual measurement, if the data set is
      severely influenced by such data problems, and on the
      experienced user if he accepts the data. The time measuring
      device at the IFMS ground station may produce so-called
      cycle-slips which can be seen in the observed frequency. This
      results in huge peaks in the residuals and the data can not be
      used, if the number of cycle-slips is too large.
 
AGC
---
      The noise level of the data and the associated signal level
      (AGC) is dependent on the distance between the spacecraft and
      the Earth. For X-Band we usually have values of about
      -50/-70 dBm, for S-Band of about -70/-80 dBm. The fluctuation
      range should not exceed 1 dBm. If there is a high noise-level
      or the signal level is extremely low, the ground station
      receiver might have been unlocked or the spacecraft operated
      in a non-coherent mode. No gradient or peaks should be visible
      in the data. Steps can be seen if telemetry is switched on/off,
      but this is not a sign for a measurement error. In case of VEX
      occultations both, ingress and egress phases, can occur in one
      plot. A drop of about 40 dB representing the occultation then
      appears in the middle of the time interval.
 
Differential Doppler
--------------------
      The data should fluctuate around 0 Hz with a maximum fluctuation
      range of 0.1 Hz, depending on the distance between spacecraft
      and Earth. The Differential Doppler is important in solar corona
      sounding measurements especially.
 
Calibration
-----------
      Occultation
 
      Calibration is done for occultation measurements using a
      Klobuchar model for the Earth ionosphere. Besides, Meteo-files
      derived at the groundstation are used for the tropospheric
      correction. The calibration data should show a smooth curve with
      small values without any steps.
 
      Gravity
 
      Until begin of 2007 calibration of gravity measurements is done
      using the Differential Doppler data. This calibration step
      corrects the effects induced by the interplanetary plasma.
      This can only be done if two downlink frequencies have been
      recorded. The Meteo-files derived at the groundstation are used
      for the tropospheric correction. If the Differential Doppler
      noise is too high, Earth ionosphere calibration is done via the
      Klobuchar-Coefficients. The calibration data should then show a
      smooth curve of small values without any steps. If the
      Differential Doppler is used, the high frequency plasma noise
      superposes the calibration curve. The overall appearance depends
      on the observation geometry. Since begin of 2007 calibration is
      always done using the Klobuchar model for Earth ionosphere. The
      Meteo-files derived at the groundstation are used for the
      tropospheric correction. The calibration data should show a
      smooth curve without steps and small values.
 
Solar Conjunction
-----------------
      Calibration is done for Solar Conjunction measurements with
      Klobuchar-Coefficients for the Earth Ionosphere. The Meteo-files
      derived at the groundstation are used for the tropospheric
      correction. The calibration data should show a smooth curve with
      small values without any steps.
 
Other Notes
-----------
      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were
      effected and where to find the corrected data.
 
      It was discovered that for IFMS the file naming convention of
      AGC raw files was crossed since beginning of the Mars Express
      mission.
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were
      swapped during the whole processing.
 
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the
      ESA station number.
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62,
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending
      on the source of the file.
 
 
      On 15.8.2007 the PI of Radio Science moved to another institute.
      Old institute: Institut fuer Geophysik und Meteorologie an der
                     Universitaet zu Koeln.
      New instiute: Rheinisches Institut fuer Umweltforschung,
                    Abteilung Planetenforschung
 
 
      Quality of data was affected by anomalous conditions.
 
      Examples include:
 
      Open-Loop Data Anomalies
      ------------------------
 
 
 
      Closed-Loop Data Anomalies
      --------------------------
      RORSI_0043: Monitor - TM dump, NN13 was stoped and restarted;
                   increased noise in X/S-Band.

<field name="data_set_description"><![CDATA[Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains photometric measurements of comet 9P/Tempel 1
    from images taken with the Medium Resolution CCD Instrument during the
    approach phase of the Deep Impact mission (from 1 May 2005 to 4 July
    2005).  These data, based on circular apertures ranging from 5 to 30
    pixels in diameter, were derived from both science and navigation
    images taken through clear filters.
 
 
    Observations
    ------------
      These tables consist of measurements performed on images taken
      from 1 May 2005 to about six hours before impact, defined here as
      05:44:34.265 UT 4 July 2005 at the flyby spacecraft.  All dates
      provided in the tables refer to the mid-point of the observation.
      The heliocentric distance of 9P/Tempel 1 goes from 1.64 AU to 1.51
      AU during approach.  A total of 3014 images were analyzed: 595
      science images and 2419 optical navigation images.
 
 
    Related Data Sets
    -----------------
      The following PDS data sets were used to derive these data:
 
        DIF-C-MRI-3/4-9P-ENCOUNTER-V2.0/DATA/RADREV : Calibrated, radiance
                                                      MRI encounter data,
                                                      version 2.0
        DIF-C-MRI-2-NAV-9P-ENCOUNTER-V1.0           : Raw MRI navigation
                                                      data
 
      Please note that MRI reversibly calibrated, radiance (RADREV) science
      images were used in this analysis.  These data were not processed to
      remove artifacts, such as cosmic rays, which sometimes affect the
      tabulated results.  Also, measurements derived from navigation images
      were acquired from the raw data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    Tables of Photometric Data
    --------------------------
      The nav_phot.tab and sci_phot.tab files are fixed-width, ASCII
      tables that contain photometric measurements of comet 9P/Tempel 1
      taken with 5, 7, 9, 15, 20, 25, and 30 pixel diameter apertures.
      Observation dates are included in the tables, as is the centroid
      position of the comet in the image.  These files additionally
      contain a column specifying the filter used to take the image and
      another column listing the centroid's distance from the horizontal
      boundary between the CCD quadrants.  For more information about
      the MRI CCD instrument and its filters, Deep Impact instruments
      publication by Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005] provided
      in the Deep Impact documentation data set,
      DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V1.0, which is archived by the PDS.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    The following assumes that the images are displayed with lines
    increasing up and samples to the right.
 
 
    Science Data
    ------------
      Photometric measurements were derived from the reversibly calibrated
      RADREV images taken through the MRI clear filters.  An additional
      background subtraction algorithm was applied to these data in order
      to remove the horizontal ''striping'' caused by electrical
      interference.  This noise, whose amplitude is on the order of a few
      DN, most adversely affects the data taken early on in the approach
      sequence.
 
      In many of these images, the comet was located on or close to the
      boundary between the upper and lower halves of the CCD.  The pixels
      in the rows surrounding this boundary are 1/6 of a pixel smaller
      than the other pixels of the CCD.  This increases the point spread
      function of objects that overlap this boundary by 1/3 of a pixel.
      Flux measurements similarly tend to be greater at the boundary.
      In about 80 percent of the images, the comet centroid lies less than
      20 pixels away from this boundary.  For a more detailed discussion
      of how this affects the data and what corrections were applied,
      please see the Deep Impact MRI photometry report included in the
      document directory of this data set.
 
      For more information about how the RADREV science data were
      calibrated, see the Deep Impact (Science) Calibration Pipeline
      Summary included in the document directory of the data set or
      the Deep Impact instrument calibration report by Klaasen, et al.
      (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006] included in the Deep Impact documentation
      data set, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V1.0, which is archived
      by the PDS.
 
 
    Optical Navigation Data
    -----------------------
      An optical navigation image consists of a number of ''snippets'',
      each containing an object of interest to the navigation team (for
      example, a guide star).  Comet 9P/Tempel 1 is always contained in one
      of these ''snippets'', which varied in size from 350x350 pixels for
      most of the approach sequence to 150x150 pixels for the last week
      before impact.  These images do not have serial and parallel
      overclock pixels and therefore needed to be treated differently from
      the science images.  Only the raw navigation images are used in this
      analysis.
 
      A background subtraction procedure was applied only to the snippet
      containing the comet.  This procedure also removed the horizontal
      striping previously discussed for all images taken more than one week
      before impact.  In data taken between UTC 2005-06-27T05:44:09.225 and
      impact, the comet's coma fills the snippet, which could therefore not
      be used to remove the background.  For this time frame, the
      background was measured in the relevant image quadrant from a raw
      science image taken close in time to the navigation image of
      interest.
 
      For a detailed description of the navigation data, please see the
      Deep Impact navigation images report included in the document
      directory of this data set.  For additional information on the
      reduction processes applied to these data, please see the Deep Impact
      MRI photometry report included in the document directory of this data
      set.

<field name="confidence_level_note"><![CDATA[Limitations
  ===========
    The following assumes that the images are displayed with lines
    increasing up and samples to the right.
 
 
    Navigation Images
    -----------------
      These data excluded the serial and parallel overclock pixels.
      Therefore, quadrant bias and background was determined from the
      edge of the snippet of interest for most of approach.  For more
      information about how the raw navigation images were processed,
      please see the Deep Impact navigation images report included
      in the document directory of this data set.
 
 
    ''Striping''
    ------------
      All the data were affected by a horizontal striping of a few DN
      in amplitude caused by electrical interference.  This primarily
      affected the early approach images.
 
 
    CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      The pixels in the two rows surrounding the horizontal boundary
      between the upper and lower halves of the CCD are each 1/6 of a
      pixel smaller than the other pixels of the CCD.  This increases
      the point spread function of objects that overlap this boundary
      by 1/3 of a pixel.  Flux measurements similarly tend to be
      greater at the boundary.
 
 
    For more on how these limitations were dealt with, see the Deep Impact
    MRI photometry report included in the document directory of this data
    set.

<field name="data_set_description"><![CDATA[Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set collects the maps of small solar system bodies prepared by
  Phil Stooke of the University of Western Ontario.  A total of 226 map
  sheets, including 18 new ones added in 2011 and 5 new ones in 2012,
  are included, some based on photomosaics from spacecraft images and some
  based on shaded relief maps prepared from spacecraft images.  The targets
  included are
 
    Asteroids -  243 Ida, 253 Mathilde, 433 Eros, 951 Gaspra, and 25143
  Itokawa.
    Satellites -  M1 Phobos, M2 Deimos, J5 Amalthea, S7 Hyperion, and S11
  Epimetheus.
    Comets - 81P/Wild 2
 
    For these maps, the prime meridian is defined according to the existing
  literature for each body.  For all synchronously rotating satellites
  (Phobos, Deimos, Amalthea, etc.) the prime meridian faces the primary
  planet.  For Gaspra, Ida, and any other objects not in synchronous rotation,
  the prime meridian is that used in the basic descriptive papers by Peter
  Thomas and colleagues for each body, and given in the IAU Working Group on
  Rotational Elements and Cartographic Coordinates triennial reports.
  Longitudes in every case increase in the direction opposite to rotation.
 
  Data
  ====
 
    The map sheets are provided as jpeg files in the document directory of the
  data set, supported by an html browse page (aamapdesc.html) and a document
  describing the map projections used (projections.asc).  In the data
  directory is an index listing the parameters describing each map
  (mapindex.tab), as well as FITS versions of all the maps which were
  prepared by SBN from the original map files, as requested at the 2012
  peer review for the convenience of data users.  The FITS versions have the
  same filenames as the corresponding jpeg map sheets in the document
  directory, but with the extension changed to .fit.
 
  The information in the browse page, the projection description, and the
  index were provided to PDS by Phil Stooke.
 
  Archiving History
  =================
 
  This data set supersedes the PDS data set EAR-A-3-RDR-STOOKEMAPS-V1.0 which
  was reviewed and archived in 2003.  The 2011 version of the data set
  (MULTI-SA-MULTI-6-STOOKEMAPS-V1.0) has the same content as the earlier
  data set with the addition of 18 new map sheets, and including new target
  bodies 25143 Itokawa and Comet 81P/Wild 2, and new maps for 433
  Eros, Phobos, and Deimos. The 2012 version (V2.0) adds five map sheets,
  one on Itokawa and four on Comet 81P/Wild 2.

    =================
      The Mars Odyssey Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) is a suite of
      three instruments working together to collect data that will
      permit the mapping of elemental concentrations on the surface
      of Mars. The suite of three instruments, the gamma-ray sensor
      head (GS), the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) neutron
      spectrometer (NS) and the Russian Academy of Science Institute
      for Space Research (IKI) high-energy neutron detector (HEND),
      are a complementary set of instruments in that the neutron
      instruments have better counting statistics and sample to a
      greater depth than the GS, but the GS determines the abundance
      of many more elements. A full description of the Mars
      Odyssey Gamma-Ray Spectrometer instrument can be found in
      [BOYNTONETAL2004].
 
      The ODY MARS GAMMA RAY SPECTROMETER 4 DHD (DHD) data set is a
      time series collection of counts and backgrounds for
      the five neutron signals obtained by HEND's four detectors.
 
      The five neutron signals of interest are the:
 
        Small Detector,  SD,  energy range 0.4 eV to 1 keV;
        Medium Detector, MD,  energy range 10 eV to 100 keV;
        Large Detector,  LD,  energy range 10 eV to 1 MeV;
        Inner Scintillator, IN_SC_LOW,
                       neutron pulse height 1 MeV to 2.5 MeV;
        Inner Scintillator, IN_SC_HIGH,
                       neutron pulse height > 2.5 MeV;
 
      Each of the GRS HEND detectors collects a new spectrum (pixel
      or frame) approximately every 20 seconds, 360 times per orbit.
      Approximately 4200 spectra are expected to be received every
      day. The data (both science and engineering) are downloaded
      from the spacecraft by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) into
      the Telemetry Data System (TDS). The TDS sends data to a process
      that translates data packets and examines instrument health via
      messages. Data are output to a spooler that passes it to both
      the University of Arizona (UA) database ingest process and to
      IKI. The UA ingest process inputs raw data into the UA database.
      IKI maintains a separate database that is used to process the
      DHD data. HEND data are processed by IKI through a number of
      processes to yield counts and backgrounds for the five
      neutron signals obtained by HEND's four detectors. The
      derived HEND data are retrieved from IKI and inserted into the
      UA database. The DHDs are prepared for PDS from the UA database.
 
      The DHD is intended to be the first intermediate data product
      available for the HEND portion of the GRS. These data should
      be useful to those scientists who are experienced in neutron
      spectroscopy.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      The DHD data set is composed of a single data type (DHD). The
      objective of compiling the DHD is to create a series of neutron
      data processed to yield local spacecraft background subtracted
      counts for each of the five distinct neutron signals.
 
      Each DHD product data file will contain a time series of
      derived neutron counts collected over an Earth Day. The
      24-hour data files will be grouped by Earth years, i.e., 365
      data files per year.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      A full description of the HEND data processing can be found in
      the Mars Odyssey Gamma-ray Spectrometer HEND Data
      Processing document located in the document folder that
      accompanies this release. The following paragraphs are a summary
      of how the data are processed from data receipt through
      background subtraction.
 
      GRS HEND data are downloaded from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft
      by JPL into the Telemetry Data System (TDS). The TDS sends the
      data to a process called GRS_tl that translates GRS packets
      from any source to any destination and examines instrument
      health via messages. The data are checked for packet types,
      header information, messages, errors, engineering and
      channelized data values and are output to a spooler and to a
      data display IDL program called GRS Displays. Data sent to the
      spooler are passed to the UA database ingestion process, which
      inputs raw data into the UA database. Data sent to the GRS
      Displays program is recorded at IKI and held in a data
      repository.  All additional steps of HEND data processing are
      done at IKI.
 
      All data packets received by the GRS Displays program are
      processed for timing and spatial information. Once time data
      are extracted from the data packet, UTC time is calculated from
      the spacecraft event time (sc_ev_time, time at the middle of
      the collection interval in 256th seconds) by a SPICE function.
      The UTC time is then inserted into the database. The spatial
      portion of the data packet is calculated using other SPICE
      routines. The returned values are all the spatial elements of
      an observation, including latitude and longitude at the
      mid-point of the observation.
 
      The HEND instrument collects five neutron signals from four
      independent detectors, whose response functions are sensitive
      to different energy regions. Raw neutron counts are reported in
      the HEND portion of the EDR data set as a 16-channel spectrum
      for each of the four detectors (SD_SPECTRUM, MD_SPECTRUM,
      LD_SPECTRUM,NEUTRON_SPECTRUM). In the DHD data set, raw neutron
      counts are reported as the sums of channels 1-16 in the SD
      (Small Detector), MD (Medium Detector), and LD (Large Detector).
      The inner scintillator records two neutron signals, LOW (sum of
      channels 1-4 in the inner scintillator) and HIGH (sum of
      channels 5-15 in the inner scintillator). The raw neutron
      counts for the LOW and HIGH signals are reported in the DHD as
      the sum of channels 1-4 and 5-15 respectively, of the
      NEUTRON_SPECTRA field of the HEND portion of the EDR data set.
 
      The background term reported for each collection interval is
      a combination of the galactic cosmic-ray flux induced
      spacecraft background and a spacecraft orbital geometry term
      to account for the shadowing by the planet of the galactic
      cosmic-ray flux. The galactic cosmic-ray flux induced
      background was measured in each detector during the cruise
      phase of the mission when the spacecraft was far from both the
      Earth and Mars. The observed background count for the
      detector of interest is multiplied by (1-omega(t)/4pi) where
      omega(t) is the solid angle subtended by Mars for the current
      position in the spacecraft orbit. The resulting term is the
      background counts in the particular collection interval for the
      detector of interest.
 
      The background subtracted counts reported for each signal in
      the DHD data set are simply the background counts subtracted
      from the summed raw counts.
 
 
    Data
    ====
      The DHD data set is composed of a series of date stamped files
      that contain 24-hours worth (00:00:00 UTC to 23:59:59 UTC) of
      data.
 
 
      Derived HEND Data
      -------------
        Derived HEND data are composed of raw counts, a
        background component, background subtracted counts
        and the associated timing and  spatial information. The five
        raw counts fields included in the DHDs consist of the
        cumulative counts of neutrons at the detector of interest
        over one collection interval. The collection interval is
        approximately 19.7 seconds, but may vary over the course of
        mapping. The five background count fields are derived from
        spatial data and count data collected during the cruise phase
        of the mission. The five background subtracted count fields
        are the background subtracted counts at the detector of
        interest over one collection interval. Timing and spatial
        data provided with the counts include spacecraft clock values
        and spacecraft geometry data. The sc_ev_time, utc time and
        spatial fields are all recorded at the center of the
        collection interval.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
      Ancillary data needed to understand the HEND data processing
      can be found in the Mars Odyssey Gamma-ray Spectrometer HEND
      Data Processing document located in the document folder that
      accompanies this release.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      The coordinate system used for all GRS data is a Mars
      areocentric system following the IAU convention
      [SEIDELMANNETAL2002], with east longitudes from 0 to 360.
 
 
    Software
    ========
      A library of source code to parse the DHD data product files
      is included in the software directory. This library allows a
      programmer to build applications that display or manipulate
      DHD data. This source is written in the Java language, and
      requires version 1.3 of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or
      Java Software Development Kit (SDK).
 
      Documentation for the code is located in the software directory
      in the file GRS_CODE_DOC.ZIP. The contents of this file are
      described in the label GRS_CODE_DOC.LBL.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
      The DHD will be delivered using DVD media. Formats will be
      based on standards for such products established by the
      Planetary Data System (PDS) [PDSSR2001].]]></field>

<field name="confidence_level_note"><![CDATA[Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      The data presented in the DHD are intended to be the first
      intermediate data set released for the HEND portion of the
      GRS. Data presented here are a highly processed representation
      of the GRS HEND data as received from the spacecraft. It is
      possible that changes will be made in the data processing
      procedures if errors are found. If errors are found, the data
      will have to be regenerated from the raw unprocessed data set.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      The DHD was reviewed internally by the GRS team prior to
      release to the PDS. PDS will perform an external peer review of
      the DHD.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      Data reported are the processed raw HEND data received from the
      spacecraft during the mapping mission stage. Data coverage and
      quality are addressed in the following sections.
 
 
      Primary Mapping
      ---------------
      The Mapping portion of the mission began February 19, 2002, and
      is expected to last until August, 2004. Primary mapping is
      broken into two phases: stowed mapping and deployed mapping.
 
 
      Stowed Mapping
      --------------
        The stowed mapping configuration began on February 19, 2002
        and lasted until June 1, 2002. The stowed mapping
        configuration is with the Odyssey spacecraft in a mapping
        orbit, with the GRS in data collection configuration
        without the 6-meter boom deployed. The reason for data
        collection in the stowed configuration is to measure the
        gamma-ray background signal from the spacecraft. The HEND
        instrument was always in the same spacecraft position. On
        June 1, 2002 the GRS was shutdown to prepare for boom
        deployment, which occurred on June 4, 2002. No data
        were collected during this time period.
 
        There are short periods of missing data due to missing
        telemetry that cannot be recovered.
 
 
      Deployed Mapping
      ----------------
        Deployed Mapping began on June 5, 2002 and is expected to
        continue until at least August, 2004.
 
        A number of solar particle events, and solar flare events
        have been recorded. HEND Data collected during these times,
        as indicated by the SUN_ACTIVITY field being greater than 1,
        are suspect.
 
        There are short data gaps due to missing telemetry that
        cannot be recovered.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    The major limitation of this data set is that it is derived from
    the raw minimally processed HEND data. The data are received
    from spacecraft telemetry, and ingested into a database. If gaps
    exist in the telemetry, data are lost. Timing and spatial
    components of the data set rely on the accuracy of the NAIF SPICE
    kernels. The validity of the derived HEND counts is based
    on the 'correctness' of each step in the processing. It is
    possible that changes will be made in the processing procedures
    if errors are found. If errors are found, the data will
    have to be regenerated from the raw unprocessed data set.
 
 
  Data Compression
  ===============
    No compression is used on the DHD data set.]]></field>

  =================
    The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP)
    CODMAC Level 5 Gridded Data Record is a collection of gridded data
    products (maps) derived from the far ultraviolet photon detections
    obtained by the LAMP instrument, corrected for instrumental effects,
    radiometrically calibrated, and correlated with the auxiliary information
    needed to locate the observations in space and time. These gridded data
    products are presented as standalone maps, formatted as standard PDS
    images, with detached PDS labels.  The LAMP GDR archive will be of
    interest to investigators studying the far ultraviolet properties of the
    Moon.
 
 
  PARAMETERS
  ==========
    The fundamental parameters contained in the LAMP GDR data set are:
 
    1) far-UV brightness
    2) far-UV albedo
    3) H2O absorption feature depths
    4) raw far-UV photon counts
    5) calibrated far-UV photon counts
    6) exposure times
    7) far-UV illumination
    8) statistical errors (noise)
    9) data quality
 
 
  PROCESSING
  ==========
    LAMP GDR data products are generated at the LAMP Science Operations Center
    (SOC), located at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.
    The map processing proceeds generally as follows.  (Please refer to the
    LAMP EDR and RDR Data Product SIS documents for more information about the
    LAMP EDR and RDR data products, as this discussion assumes the existence
    of LAMP RDR products containing radiometrically calibrated and spatially
    located far-UV photon detections.)  From each RDR product a corresponding
    'exposure record' is generated that records the exposure time of each LAMP
    spatial pixel in each map cell.  Calibrated photon counts (i.e.,
    photons/cm2, where the cm2 is related to the wavelength-dependent
    instrument effective area) from the RDR products are then paired with
    these exposure records, one-to-one, to produce integrated photon count and
    exposure maps.  These, in turn, are used to generate the brightness maps
    themselves.  Far-UV illumination models are separately used to estimate
    the time-dependent far-UV flux incident on the Moon's night side and
    permanently shaded regions (PSRs).  These, combined with the brightness
    maps yield the albedo maps.  Finally, the ratios of the off-band
    brightness/albedo to the on-band brightness/albedo yields the H2O
    absorption feature depth maps.
 
 
  DATA
  ====
    As alluded to above, the LAMP Gridded Data Record contains the following
    nine types of maps:
 
    1) far-UV brightness - units are photons/cm2/sec/sr
                         - four wavelength ranges are included:
                             Lyman-alpha  (119.57 nm - 123.57 nm)
                             full stellar (129.57 nm - 189.57 nm)
                             on-band      (129.57 nm - 155.57 nm)
                             off-band     (155.57 nm - 189.57 nm)
    2) far-UV albedo - units are dimensionless albedo
                     - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    3) H2O absorption feature depths (ratios) - units are dimensionless
    4) raw photon counts - units are photons
                         - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    5) calibrated photon counts - units are photons/cm2
                                - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    6) exposure times - units are secs
    7) far-UV illumination - units are photons/cm2/sec
                           - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    8) statistical errors (noise) - units are photons/cm2
                                  - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    9) data quality - units are dimensionless
                    - the above four wavelength ranges are used
 
    All of these maps are derived from 'night side' data (i.e., when the LAMP
    detector FOV was located on the night side of the Moon or in a permanently
    shaded region [PSR] and the instrument aperture door was open).  In
    addition to the cumulative ensemble average maps generated using data
    taken during the whole nominal ESMD phase of the LRO mission, monthly maps
    are also provided for all of the above products except for the H2O
    absorption feature depth maps.
 
    Each map is a polar stereographic map centered on either the north or
    south lunar pole and extending 10 degrees in latitude away from the pole
    (i.e., to either +80 deg or -80 deg latitude).  Each map has a true
    resolution at the pole of 240 meters/pixel, thus yielding a map of
    2501 x 2501 pixels.  Each map element is stored using a 4-byte floating
    point value, thus giving a total size of 25 MB per map image.
 
    For each map type (except for the exposure and H2O absorption feature
    depth maps) there are 112 maps (4 wavelength ranges x 2 poles x 14
    [13 monthly + 1 cumulative]).  Since the exposure times are the same for
    all wavelengths, there are only 28 exposure maps.  Also, there are only
    4 H2O absorption feature depth maps (2 [brightness and albedo as ratio
    source] x 2 poles).  All told, there are 816 total maps in the GDR data
    set.
 
 
  ANCILLARY DATA
  ==============
    Other than the ancillary data used in the generation of the LAMP RDR data
    set, the only ancillary data specifically used in the creation of the LAMP
    GDR data set is the illumination model (used to generate the illumination
    maps, which are in turn used to derive the albedo maps).
 
    The ancillary data used in the generation of the LAMP RDR data set include
    those calibration values required to apply instrumental corrections and
    calibrations to the science data as well as trajectory and pointing
    information for the LRO spacecraft and clock conversion tables required
    to enable the geometric calibration of the science data.  The source of
    the instrumental calibration data are the LAMP engineers and LAMP
    scientists at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas
    [see GLADSTONEETAL2008 for further details], while the source of the
    spacecraft trajectory, pointing, and clock data are SPICE kernels
    provided to the LAMP SOC by the LRO MOC, having been ultimately generated
    by the MOC itself, the Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) at GSFC, or the
    Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL.
 
 
  COORDINATE SYSTEM
  =================
    The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission uses a standard coordinate
    system to describe all RDR (and hence GDR) data, namely lunar
    planetocentric/body-fixed coordinates with east-positive longitude from 0
    to 360 degrees.  A mean Earth/polar axis (ME) reference system (also
    called the mean Earth/rotation system) is used, with the z-axis being the
    mean rotational pole and with the prime meridian (zero degrees longitude)
    defined by the mean Earth direction.
 
    The ME reference system is used for all LRO archival data.  This LRO
    standard is documented in 'A Standardized Lunar Coordinate System for
    the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, LRO Project White Paper, 451-SCI-000958,
    Version 4, May 14, 2008'.  Using coordinates in the ME system is
    consistent with recommendations from the International Astronomical Union
    (IAU)/International Association of Geodesy (IAG) Working Group on
    Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements.
 
    A Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) planetary and lunar ephemeris and
    corresponding Euler angle set are used to define an ME frame to which the
    LRO data are registered.  The LRO Data Working Group (LDWG) determines
    which ephemeris and Euler angle set should be used.  Alternatively, LRO
    data can be registered to an existing or new reference frame in the ME
    system, via ties to surface points known in the frame (examples include
    Lunar Laser Ranging [LLR] retroreflectors, points in images and Digital
    Elevation Models).
 
    When a JPL planetary and lunar ephemeris is used, the JPL Navigation and
    Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) provides the necessary lunar
    ephemeris file (SPK) and binary lunar orientation file (PCK) in a
    Principal Axes (PA) reference frame for use with the SPICE Toolkit.  NAIF
    also provides the frames kernel (FK) used for accessing the PA orientation
    in the PCK and for transforming from the PA frame to the ME frame.
 
    Alternatively, the JPL lunar ephemeris information is available in an
    ASCII format not requiring the use of the SPICE Toolkit.  This information
    is available from a JPL website: http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov.
 
 
  SOFTWARE
  ========
    Because the LAMP GDR data product files adhere to the image format
    described in version 3 of the PDS standards reference, the PDS-supplied
    NASAView software should be able to successfully read these files.  There
    are likely other such image readers freely available in the public domain
    capable of reading the LAMP GDR maps.
 
 
  MEDIA/FORMAT
  ============
    The LAMP GDR data product files are written in standard PDS image (.img)
    format, and the format of each file is described in an accompanying
    detached PDS label.  The GDR archive itself will be written on hard drive
    media and physically delivered from the LAMP SOC to the PDS Imaging Node,
    where it will be made generally available via the World Wide Web.]]></field>

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Single beam visible/InfraRed Intelligent Spectroradiometer
      (SIRIS) is a field-portable grating spectrometer manufactured
      by Geophysical and Environmental Research, Inc.  The system is
      controlled by a portable computer and spectra are saved in
      digital format on 3 1/2 inch computer disks.  The SIRIS
      measures radiance using three separate gratings on a single
      stepper motor driven mount.  The standard operating mode (from
      0.35 to 2.5 micrometers) consists of a scan from 0.35
      micrometer to 1.08 micrometer using the first grating, from
      1.08 micrometer to 1.8 micrometer with the second grating, and
      from 1.8 micrometer to 2.5 micrometer with the third grating.
      Grating 1 uses a silicon detector with sensitivity out to about
      1.1 m.  A PbS detector is used for the 1.1 to 2.5 micrometer
      portion of the spectrum.  Both detectors are temperature
      stabilized on the same thermal electric cooler.  Three blocking
      filters are used to prevent 2nd order contamination effects.
      The first blocking filter cuts off at about 0.65 micrometer,
      the second at approximately 1.05 micrometer, and the third at
      approximately 1.7 micrometer.  Analog output signals are
      processed through phase sensitive detector systems with narrow
      band electronic filtering.  Analog to digital conversion in the
      microcomputer results in 12 bit digital data.
 
      Because the SIRIS is a single-beam instrument, it is necessary
      to measure reference and sample radiance spectra separately.
      Spectra are typically measured using solar illumination and
      HALON as a reflectance standard.  HALON is a highly reflective
      material with no absorption features in the 0.4 to 2.5
      micrometer range.  The reference spectrum is measured first and
      stored on disk.  Depending on sky conditions, a reference
      spectrum should be measured before each sample spectrum unless
      atmospheric conditions are clear and dry, in which case a new
      reference spectrum may not be needed each time.  The sample is
      measured next and both the reference and the sample radiance
      spectra are automatically stored together in a disk file that
      can later be reduced to reflectance.  The reflectance spectrum
      can be viewed prior to proceeding to the next measurement.
 
      The SIRIS spectral sampling interval varies continuously with
      wavelength.  In all cases, the actual resolution (sampling
      interval x 2) is greater than the AVIRIS resolution of 10 nm.

  ===================
    Overview
    ========
 
    The High Rate Detector (HRD) is part of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer
    (CDA) on the Cassini mission payload.  The overall objective of
    the HRD is to carry out quantitative measurements of particle flux
    and mass distribution throughout the Saturn ring system. The
    particle impact rate and particle mass distribution will be
    determined with respect to Saturnian distances, distance from the
    rings, and to magnetospheric coordinates.  The particle mass range
    covered by the HRD (assuming a particle impact velocity of 15
    km/s) ranges from 8x10^-13 to 8x10^-8 g for differential and
    cumulative flux measurements, and > 8x10^-8 g for cumulative flux
    measurements.  For full information about the HRD instrument, see
    Srama et al. (2004).
 
    General Description
    ===================
 
    The HRD was designed, built and tested at the University of
    Chicago and measures differential and cumulative particle fluxes.
    The HRD has a high counting rate capability (up to 10^4 random
    impacts/s with <5% corrections) which will be particularly
    important during Saturn ring plane crossings, where fluxes are
    large enough to saturate the counting rate of DA (~1 c/s).
 
    The HRD has significant inheritance from the University of Chicago
    Dust Counter and Mass Analyzer instrument (DUCMA) flown earlier on
    the Vega-1 and Vega-2 spacecraft to Comet Halley (Perkins et al.,
    1985). The instrument employs the dust particle detection
    technique described by Simpson and Tuzzolino (1985) and consists
    of two polyvinylidene fluoride sensors with associated
    electronics. The PVDF sensors are round in shape with areas of 50
    cm^2 and 10 cm^2 respectively, and are mounted together as a unit
    on the front of the HRD electronics box. For images showing the
    geometry of the sensors see the figures in Srama et al. (2004).
    The HRD detects individual particles impacting the PVDF sensors
    and provides continuous measurements of cumulative particle fluxes
    for particle masses greater than four mass thresholds for each of
    the two sensors (see Table I).
 
    The HRD is an independent instrument containing its own memory and
    processor. The only interface to the Dust Analyzer (DA) of the CDA
    is via the power and data cables. HRD power is supplied by the DA
    main electronics and data transfer responds by latching the
    appropriate data into the HRD data output register. The latching
    of the data generates an interrupt to DA indicating that the data
    is ready to be read by DA and stored into DA memory.
 
    The HRD is rigidly mounted to the DA so that as the CDA turntable
    is rotated, the HRD scans different particle arrival directions.
    The HRD pointing is exactly the same as the DA pointing.
 
    HRD Instrument Specifications
    =============================
 
    Sensor #1: 50 cm^2, 28 microns thick PVDF detector;
    Sensor #2: 10 cm^2, 6 microns thick PVDF detector.
    Both sensors are sensitive to dust particles with velocity > 1
    km/s.
    Each sensor has four mass thresholds (M1, M2, M3, M4 for sensor #1
    and m1, m2, m3, m4 for sensor #2).These thresholds were set at
    values showing in the Table I for particles with a velocity of 15
    km/sec.
 
    Discrete events: recording of impact time (1 s accuracy) and
    threshold firings for each impact
    Counting rates: up to 10^4/s with no corrections, while for rates
    10^4 to 10^5 c/s the corrections have been determined and are
    known. We have not encountered such high rates during the entire
    Cassini mission
 
    Operating modes
    ===============
 
    1. NORMAL MODE (CRUISE): Continuous recording by the HRD of
    individual particle impact time, threshold firings for each
    impact, and integral counts.  This operating mode will be used for
    all interplanetary data collection.  It may also be used during
    ring plane crossings up to particle impact rates of approximately
    few hundred impacts/s.
 
    2. FAST MODE (ENCOUNTER, RING PLANE): Integral counts are recorded
    and stored by the HRD each At seconds during ring plane crossings.
    The time interval At is selectable at 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, 1.0 s.
    At the highest time resolution (At = 0.1 s) the spatial resolution
    for the counting rates will be ~ 1 km.
 
    3. CALIBRATE MODE: Periodic electronic calibration of the HRD with
    the HRD inflight calibrator. This mode allows assessment of the
    electronic stability of the HRD throughout the mission.
 
    PVDF Dust Sensors
    =================
 
    The theory, fabrication and details of PVDF dust detector
    operation have been described in earlier reports (Simpson and
    Tuzzolino, 1985; Perkins et al., 1985; Simpson et al., 1989). A
    PVDF sensor consists of a thin film of permanently polarized
    material. A hypervelocity dust particle impacting the sensor
    produces rapid local destruction of dipoles (crater or penetration
    hole) which results in a large and fast current pulse at the input
    to the electronics (ns time range). The output pulse is sharp in
    time, with a maximum amplitude depending on impacting particle
    mass and velocity. Since the depolarization induced current pulse
    is fast, the output pulse shape is determined by the choice of
    electronic time constants for the pre-amplifiers and shapers.
    Electronic time constants (amplifier shaping time constants,
    discriminator width) in the few microsecond range permit a high
    counting rate capability for the HRD sensor-electronics
    combination (10^4 random impacts/s with <5% corrections). The high
    counting rate capability of the HRD is of particular importance
    for Saturn ring plane crossings, where high dust particle fluxes
    are encountered.
 
    Exposure Degradation of the PVDF Sensors
    ========================================
 
    The HRD PVDF detector efficiency is proportional to the detector
    area.
    It is expected that with exposure to high dust flux there will be
    some
    degradation of the detectors due to the physical removal of some
    of
    the area by the impacting dust particles.  However, for the small
    particles (most cosmic dust particles are less than 10 microns)
    the
    removed area is negligible compared to the total detector area of
    10 or 50 cm^2.
 
    Acoustic Signal Suppression
    ===========================
 
    PVDF detectors have a secondary but minor mode of response due to
    their piezoelectric properties. Therefore, background acoustic
    disturbances of sufficient intensity could trigger the HRD PVDF
    detector thresholds, and these threshold firings could be
    mistakenly recorded as dust particle impacts.  During the
    Cassini-Huygens mission, possible sources of acoustic disturbances
    include spacecraft gas jets, moving platforms, and large particle
    impacts on structures near the mounting positions of the HRD PVDF
    sensors.
 
    To minimize the effects of the possible acoustic backgrounds, the
    HRD PVDF sensors are mounted in sound absorbing pads. This design
    was highly effective in suppressing the acoustic response from
    mechanical shocks (Perkins et al., 1985).
 
    Thermal Aspects
    ===============
 
    Thermal Control. Although our studies have shown that PVDF sensors
    may be operated at temperatures up to ~+80 C for long periods of
    time (weeks) with small (<5%) degradation in dust particle
    response, our HRD sensor mounting technique, discussed above,
    acoustically and thermally insulates the sensor from its
    surroundings. Under these conditions, the effective sensor
    emissivity and absorbtivity are such that exposure of a PVDF
    sensor in space to direct solar illumination for a short period of
    time (~1 min) would result in sensor temperatures high enough to
    destroy the sensor.  Since there have been the possibility of
    direct exposure of the HRD sensors to solar illumination at a
    radial distance of 0.68 AU from the Sun during the Cassini-Huygens
    mission (Jaffe and Herrell, 1997), we studied different sensor
    coating techniques which would restrict the sensor temperature to
    ~80 C during solar exposure at 0.68 AU.
 
    Temperature dependence of sensor output signal
    ==============================================
 
    Of the several PVDF material parameters which determine the
    magnitude of the PVDF detector depolarization charge signal
    resulting from an impacting dust particle (Simpson and Tuzzolino,
    1985), the volume polarization magnitude, P, and its temperature
    dependence are the most important for determining the temperature
    dependence of the signal amplitude. Our laboratory measurements
    have shown that over the temperature range -50 to +80 C, the
    charge signal amplitude will vary by less than 6% from the values
    measured at room temperature. Thus, we expected an overall
    possible variation in output signal amplitude resulting from both
    detector capacitance and depolarization charge signal temperature
    effects of less than 10% over the expected temperature range for
    the detector. This maximum 10% effect will contribute a negligible
    uncertainty for the particle mass thresholds.
 
    HRD Electronics, Digital Data and Commands
    ==========================================
 
    The HRD linear electronics consists of charge sensitive
    pre-amplifiers (CSA), shaping amplifiers (SHAPER) and threshold
    discriminators. Each SHAPER provides single integration ~V single
    differentiation RC shaping with a shaping time constant of 2
    microsec.  A particle impact on either sensor #1 or sensor #2 will
    result in output signals from the shapers  which may trigger the
    M1, M2, M3, M4 thresholds for sensor #1, and m1, m2, m3, and m4
    for sensor #2. As a contingency either M or m, or both thresholds
    may be increased by a factor of 10 by ground command.
 
    Every time a dust particle hits one of the sensors, the event will
    increment one or more 16-bit counters associated with this
    particular sensor and set the 8-bit event latch, according to what
    thresholds are triggered. For a higher threshold to be fired, the
    lower threshold associated with the same sensor will also be
    fired. There are 4 thresholds for each detector and each threshold
    is connected to one of the counters. The thresholds for the large
    detector are indicated by M1, M2, M3, M4 and the thresholds for
    the smaller detector are indicated by m1, m2, m3, m4.  The 8-bit
    latch indicates which threshold fired when an event occurs.
 
    In normal mode if a discrete event occurs or data is requested by
    the
    Dust Analyzer instrument and the storage buffer is empty, the
    21-bit
    clock and the 8-bit latch are stored into HRD memory.  When 256
    discrete events have been stored, HRD stores the 64-byte header.
    The
    header consists of a 24-bit sync word, 8-bit HRD status, 32-bit
    HRD
    clock, 32-bit spacecraft clock, temperature, and the eight 16-bit
    counters.
 
    In fast mode, HRD will store the Fast Mode header at an interval
    form .1 sec to 1 sec, depending on which time interval is
    selected. The header is stored at the selected interval until the
    memory buffer is full.  Once the buffer is full HRD will
    automatically switch back to normal mode and will only store data
    when room is available in the buffer.

    HRD Commands
    ============
 
    When the CDA main electronics supplies power to the HRD, the HRD
    turn on in NORMAL (CRUISE) MODE, with a sensor mass threshold
    relays in the ~SLOW MASS~T positions.
 
    HRD commands include:
 
    (a) ENCOUNTER MODE: Selects delta t at one value in the range
    delta t = 0.1, 0.2, ...,0.9, 1.0 s and runs the HRD in ENCOUNTER
    MODE.
    (b) SET RELAY: Selects the threshold relay switches for each
    sensor to LOW MASS RANGE or HIGH MASS RANGE (see Table I).
    (c) IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATE (IFC): Initiates a sequence of electronic
    pulses of varying amplitude within the HRD electronics which
    permits assessment of the stability of the HRD electronics.
 
    PVDF Sensor Calibrations
    ========================
 
    Particle calibrations of HRD-type PVDF sensors (28 and 6 microns
    thick) were carried out at the Heidelberg and Munich dust
    accelerator facilities, as summarized in Table 10 of Tuzzolino
    (1996). The calibration data show that the signal amplitude N may
    be fit by a power-law dependence on particle mass and velocity of
    the form m^av^b, with values for the mass index a and velocity
    index b, as given in the expressions included.
 
    From these data, and an assumed ring plane crossing particle
    impact velocity of 15 km/s the electronic thresholds set for the
    HRD flight unit will result in the particle mass thresholds given
    in Table I. The upper half of Table I lists the electronic and
    particle mass thresholds for the case where the sensor mass
    threshold switches are set for LOW MASS, and the lower half of
    Table I for the case where the switches are set for HIGH MASS (by
    ground command).

    Overview
    ========
 
    The High Rate Detector (HRD) is part of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer
    (CDA) on the Cassini mission payload.  The overall objective of
    the HRD is to carry out quantitative measurements of particle flux
    and mass distribution throughout the Saturn ring system. The
    particle impact rate and particle mass distribution will be
    determined with respect to Saturnian distances, distance from the
    rings, and to magnetospheric coordinates.  The particle mass range
    covered by the HRD (assuming a particle impact velocity of 15
    km/s) ranges from 8x10^-13 to 8x10^-8 g for differential and
    cumulative flux measurements, and > 8x10^-8 g for cumulative flux
    measurements.  For full information about the HRD instrument, see
    Srama et al. (2004).
 
    General Description
    ===================
 
    The HRD was designed, built and tested at the University of
    Chicago and measures differential and cumulative particle fluxes.
    The HRD has a high counting rate capability (up to 10^4 random
    impacts/s with <5% corrections) which will be particularly
    important during Saturn ring plane crossings, where fluxes are
    large enough to saturate the counting rate of DA (~1 c/s).
 
    The HRD has significant inheritance from the University of Chicago
    Dust Counter and Mass Analyzer instrument (DUCMA) flown earlier on
    the Vega-1 and Vega-2 spacecraft to Comet Halley (Perkins et al.,
    1985). The instrument employs the dust particle detection
    technique described by Simpson and Tuzzolino (1985) and consists
    of two polyvinylidene fluoride sensors with associated
    electronics. The PVDF sensors are round in shape with areas of 50
    cm^2 and 10 cm^2 respectively, and are mounted together as a unit
    on the front of the HRD electronics box. For images showing the
    geometry of the sensors see the figures in Srama et al. (2004).
    The HRD detects individual particles impacting the PVDF sensors
    and provides continuous measurements of cumulative particle fluxes
    for particle masses greater than four mass thresholds for each of
    the two sensors (see Table I).
 
    The HRD is an independent instrument containing its own memory and
    processor. The only interface to the Dust Analyzer (DA) of the CDA
    is via the power and data cables. HRD power is supplied by the DA
    main electronics and data transfer responds by latching the
    appropriate data into the HRD data output register. The latching
    of the data generates an interrupt to DA indicating that the data
    is ready to be read by DA and stored into DA memory.
 
    The HRD is rigidly mounted to the DA so that as the CDA turntable
    is rotated, the HRD scans different particle arrival directions.
    The HRD pointing is exactly the same as the DA pointing.
 
    HRD Instrument Specifications
    =============================
 
    Sensor #1: 50 cm^2, 28 microns thick PVDF detector;
    Sensor #2: 10 cm^2, 6 microns thick PVDF detector.
    Both sensors are sensitive to dust particles with velocity > 1
    km/s.
    Each sensor has four mass thresholds (M1, M2, M3, M4 for sensor #1
    and m1, m2, m3, m4 for sensor #2).These thresholds were set at
    values showing in the Table I for particles with a velocity of 15
    km/sec.
 
    Discrete events: recording of impact time (1 s accuracy) and
    threshold firings for each impact
    Counting rates: up to 10^4/s with no corrections, while for rates
    10^4 to 10^5 c/s the corrections have been determined and are
    known. We have not encountered such high rates during the entire
    Cassini mission
 
    Operating modes
    ===============
 
    1. NORMAL MODE (CRUISE): Continuous recording by the HRD of
    individual particle impact time, threshold firings for each
    impact, and integral counts.  This operating mode will be used for
    all interplanetary data collection.  It may also be used during
    ring plane crossings up to particle impact rates of approximately
    few hundred impacts/s.
 
    2. FAST MODE (ENCOUNTER, RING PLANE): Integral counts are recorded
    and stored by the HRD each At seconds during ring plane crossings.
    The time interval At is selectable at 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, 1.0 s.
    At the highest time resolution (At = 0.1 s) the spatial resolution
    for the counting rates will be ~ 1 km.
 
    3. CALIBRATE MODE: Periodic electronic calibration of the HRD with
    the HRD inflight calibrator. This mode allows assessment of the
    electronic stability of the HRD throughout the mission.
 
    PVDF Dust Sensors
    =================
 
    The theory, fabrication and details of PVDF dust detector
    operation have been described in earlier reports (Simpson and
    Tuzzolino, 1985; Perkins et al., 1985; Simpson et al., 1989). A
    PVDF sensor consists of a thin film of permanently polarized
    material. A hypervelocity dust particle impacting the sensor
    produces rapid local destruction of dipoles (crater or penetration
    hole) which results in a large and fast current pulse at the input
    to the electronics (ns time range). The output pulse is sharp in
    time, with a maximum amplitude depending on impacting particle
    mass and velocity. Since the depolarization induced current pulse
    is fast, the output pulse shape is determined by the choice of
    electronic time constants for the pre-amplifiers and shapers.
    Electronic time constants (amplifier shaping time constants,
    discriminator width) in the few microsecond range permit a high
    counting rate capability for the HRD sensor-electronics
    combination (10^4 random impacts/s with <5% corrections). The high
    counting rate capability of the HRD is of particular importance
    for Saturn ring plane crossings, where high dust particle fluxes
    are encountered.
 
    Exposure Degradation of the PVDF Sensors
    ========================================
 
    The HRD PVDF detector efficiency is proportional to the detector
    area.
    It is expected that with exposure to high dust flux there will be
    some
    degradation of the detectors due to the physical removal of some
    of
    the area by the impacting dust particles.  However, for the small
    particles (most cosmic dust particles are less than 10 microns)
    the
    removed area is negligible compared to the total detector area of
    10 or 50 cm^2.
 
    Acoustic Signal Suppression
    ===========================
 
    PVDF detectors have a secondary but minor mode of response due to
    their piezoelectric properties. Therefore, background acoustic
    disturbances of sufficient intensity could trigger the HRD PVDF
    detector thresholds, and these threshold firings could be
    mistakenly recorded as dust particle impacts.  During the
    Cassini-Huygens mission, possible sources of acoustic disturbances
    include spacecraft gas jets, moving platforms, and large particle
    impacts on structures near the mounting positions of the HRD PVDF
    sensors.
 
    To minimize the effects of the possible acoustic backgrounds, the
    HRD PVDF sensors are mounted in sound absorbing pads. This design
    was highly effective in suppressing the acoustic response from
    mechanical shocks (Perkins et al., 1985).
 
    Thermal Aspects
    ===============
 
    Thermal Control. Although our studies have shown that PVDF sensors
    may be operated at temperatures up to ~+80 C for long periods of
    time (weeks) with small (<5%) degradation in dust particle
    response, our HRD sensor mounting technique, discussed above,
    acoustically and thermally insulates the sensor from its
    surroundings. Under these conditions, the effective sensor
    emissivity and absorbtivity are such that exposure of a PVDF
    sensor in space to direct solar illumination for a short period of
    time (~1 min) would result in sensor temperatures high enough to
    destroy the sensor.  Since there have been the possibility of
    direct exposure of the HRD sensors to solar illumination at a
    radial distance of 0.68 AU from the Sun during the Cassini-Huygens
    mission (Jaffe and Herrell, 1997), we studied different sensor
    coating techniques which would restrict the sensor temperature to
    ~80 C during solar exposure at 0.68 AU.
 
    Temperature dependence of sensor output signal
    ==============================================
 
    Of the several PVDF material parameters which determine the
    magnitude of the PVDF detector depolarization charge signal
    resulting from an impacting dust particle (Simpson and Tuzzolino,
    1985), the volume polarization magnitude, P, and its temperature
    dependence are the most important for determining the temperature
    dependence of the signal amplitude. Our laboratory measurements
    have shown that over the temperature range -50 to +80 C, the
    charge signal amplitude will vary by less than 6% from the values
    measured at room temperature. Thus, we expected an overall
    possible variation in output signal amplitude resulting from both
    detector capacitance and depolarization charge signal temperature
    effects of less than 10% over the expected temperature range for
    the detector. This maximum 10% effect will contribute a negligible
    uncertainty for the particle mass thresholds.
 
    HRD Electronics, Digital Data and Commands
    ==========================================
 
    The HRD linear electronics consists of charge sensitive
    pre-amplifiers (CSA), shaping amplifiers (SHAPER) and threshold
    discriminators. Each SHAPER provides single integration ~V single
    differentiation RC shaping with a shaping time constant of 2
    microsec.  A particle impact on either sensor #1 or sensor #2 will
    result in output signals from the shapers  which may trigger the
    M1, M2, M3, M4 thresholds for sensor #1, and m1, m2, m3, and m4
    for sensor #2. As a contingency either M or m, or both thresholds
    may be increased by a factor of 10 by ground command.
 
    Every time a dust particle hits one of the sensors, the event will
    increment one or more 16-bit counters associated with this
    particular sensor and set the 8-bit event latch, according to what
    thresholds are triggered. For a higher threshold to be fired, the
    lower threshold associated with the same sensor will also be
    fired. There are 4 thresholds for each detector and each threshold
    is connected to one of the counters. The thresholds for the large
    detector are indicated by M1, M2, M3, M4 and the thresholds for
    the smaller detector are indicated by m1, m2, m3, m4.  The 8-bit
    latch indicates which threshold fired when an event occurs.
 
    In normal mode if a discrete event occurs or data is requested by
    the
    Dust Analyzer instrument and the storage buffer is empty, the
    21-bit
    clock and the 8-bit latch are stored into HRD memory.  When 256
    discrete events have been stored, HRD stores the 64-byte header.
    The
    header consists of a 24-bit sync word, 8-bit HRD status, 32-bit
    HRD
    clock, 32-bit spacecraft clock, temperature, and the eight 16-bit
    counters.
 
    In fast mode, HRD will store the Fast Mode header at an interval
    form .1 sec to 1 sec, depending on which time interval is
    selected. The header is stored at the selected interval until the
    memory buffer is full.  Once the buffer is full HRD will
    automatically switch back to normal mode and will only store data
    when room is available in the buffer.

    HRD Commands
    ============
 
    When the CDA main electronics supplies power to the HRD, the HRD
    turn on in NORMAL (CRUISE) MODE, with a sensor mass threshold
    relays in the ~SLOW MASS~T positions.
 
    HRD commands include:
 
    (a) ENCOUNTER MODE: Selects delta t at one value in the range
    delta t = 0.1, 0.2, ...,0.9, 1.0 s and runs the HRD in ENCOUNTER
    MODE.
    (b) SET RELAY: Selects the threshold relay switches for each
    sensor to LOW MASS RANGE or HIGH MASS RANGE (see Table I).
    (c) IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATE (IFC): Initiates a sequence of electronic
    pulses of varying amplitude within the HRD electronics which
    permits assessment of the stability of the HRD electronics.
 
    PVDF Sensor Calibrations
    ========================
 
    Particle calibrations of HRD-type PVDF sensors (28 and 6 microns
    thick) were carried out at the Heidelberg and Munich dust
    accelerator facilities, as summarized in Table 10 of Tuzzolino
    (1996). The calibration data show that the signal amplitude N may
    be fit by a power-law dependence on particle mass and velocity of
    the form m^av^b, with values for the mass index a and velocity
    index b, as given in the expressions included.
 
    From these data, and an assumed ring plane crossing particle
    impact velocity of 15 km/s the electronic thresholds set for the
    HRD flight unit will result in the particle mass thresholds given
    in Table I. The upper half of Table I lists the electronic and
    particle mass thresholds for the case where the sensor mass
    threshold switches are set for LOW MASS, and the lower half of
    Table I for the case where the switches are set for HIGH MASS (by
    ground command).

  ===================
    The Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) will
    provide remote measurements of mineralogy and thermophysical
    properties of the scene surrounding the Mars Exploration Rovers,
    and guide the Rovers to key targets for detailed in situ
    measurements by other Rover experiments.  The Mini-TES is a
    Fourier Transform Spectrometer covering the spectral range
    5-29 micrometers (339.50 to 1997.06 cm-1) with a spectral sample
    interval of 9.99 cm-1. The Mini-TES telescope is a 6.35-cm diameter
    Cassegrain telescope that feeds a flat-plate Michelson moving
    mirror mounted on a voice-coil motor assembly. A single deuterated
    triglycine sulfate (DTGS) uncooled pyroelectric detector with
    proven space heritage gives a spatial resolution of 20 mrad; an
    actuated field stop can reduce the field of view to 8 mrad.
    Mini-TES is mounted within the Rover's Warm Electronics Box and
    views the terrain using its internal telescope looking up the hollow
    shaft of the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA) to the fixed fold mirror
    and rotating elevation scan mirror in the PMA head located ~1.5 m
    above the ground. The PMA provides a full 360 degree of azimuth
    travel and views from 30 degrees above the nominal horizon to 50
    degrees below. An interferogram is collected every two seconds, and
    transmitted to the Rover computer where the Fast Fourier Transform,
    spectral summing, lossless compression, and data formatting are
    performed prior to transmission to Earth. Radiometric calibration is
    provided by two calibration V-groove blackbody targets instrumented
    with platinum thermistor temperature sensors with absolute
    temperature calibration of +/-0.1 K. One calibration target is
    located inside the PMA head, the second is on the Rover deck. The
    Mini-TES temperature is expected to vary diurnally from 263 to 303
    K, with most surface composition data collected at scene
    temperatures >270 K. For these conditions the radiometric precision
    for two-spectra summing is +/-1.8 x10-8 W cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 between
    450 and 1500 cm-1, increasing to ~4.2 x10-8 W cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 at
    shorter (300 cm-1) and longer (1800 cm-1) wavenumbers. The absolute
    radiance error will be <5 x10-8 Watt cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1, decreasing to
    ~1 x10-8 Watt cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 over the wavenumber range where the
    scene temperature will be determined (1200-1600 cm-1). The
    worst-case sum of these random and systematic radiance errors
    correspond to an absolute temperature error of ~0.4 K for a true
    surface temperature of 270 K, and ~1.5 K for a surface at 180 K. The
    Mini-TES will be operated in a 20-mrad panorama mode and an 8-mrad
    targeted mode, producing 2-dimensional rasters and 3-dimensional
    hyperspectral image cubes of varying sizes. The overall Mini-TES
    envelope size is 23.5 cm x 16.3 cm x 15.5 cm and the mass is
    2.40 kg. The power consumption is 5.6 W average. The Mini-TES was
    developed by Arizona State University and Raytheon Santa Barbara
    Remote Sensing (SBRS).   Information in this instrument description
    is taken from The Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer for the
    Mars Exploration Rovers paper [CHRISTENSENETAL2003]. See this paper
    for more details.
 
 
  Scientific Objectives
  =====================
    The chief scientific objectives of the Mini-TES are:
 
    1) determine the mineralogy of rocks and soils, and
 
    2) determine the thermophysical properties of selected soil patches,
       and
 
    3) determine the temperature profile, dust opacity, water-ice
       opacity, and water vapor abundance in the lower boundary layer of
       atmosphere
 
 
  Calibration
  ===========
    The initial Mini-TES calibration and test was performed at SBRS
    prior to delivery to JPL, and a subset of these tests was performed
    on the integrated Mini-TES/PMA assembly. The objectives of these
    tests were to determine:
 
    (1) the field-of-view definition and alignment;
 
    (2) the out-of-field response;
 
    (3) the spectrometer spectral line shape and spectral sample
        position; and
 
    (4) the spectrometer radiometric calibration.
 
    Bench-level testing of the Mini-TES instrument was performed at SBRS
    in two phases. The first phase consisted of piece-part and
    system-level testing of the spectral performance of each sub-section
    under ambient conditions. The second phase consisted of field of
    view and out-of-field tests conducted before and after vibration and
    thermalvacuum testing to determine and confirm the instrument
    field-of-view and alignment. Mini-TES I was operated for a total of
    166 hours and Mini-TES II was operated for 594 hours at SBRS prior
    to initial delivery to JPL. The Mini-TES spectrometer, without the
    PMA, was tested and calibrated in vacuum at SBRS at instrument
    temperatures of -243, 263, 283, and 303 K. A matrix of calibration
    tests were performed viewing two precision calibration reference
    blackbody standards, one set at 223 K, 243 K, 263 K, and 283 K.
    While the second was varied at temperatures of 145 K, 190 K, 235 K,
    280 K, and 325 K. The Mini-TES/PMA systems were radiometrically
    calibrated in 6 mbar of nitrogen at instrument temperatures of 243,
    273, and 303 K over a range of calibration blackbody temperatures.
    These tests determined:
 
    (1) the emissivity and effective temperature of the internal
        reference surface;
 
    (2) the instrument response function and its variation with
        instrument temperature;
 
    (3) the absolute radiometric accuracy;
 
    (4) the spectrometer noise characteristics; and
 
    (5) the spectrometer gain values.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    The Mini-TES has many performance requirements, that if not met
    could significantly compromise the quality of the data obtained.
 
    Mineralogic mapping has three measurement requirements:
 
    (1) radiometric accuracy and precision necessary to uniquely
        determine the mineral abundances in mixtures to within 5%
        absolute abundance;
 
    (2) spectral resolution sufficient to uniquely determine the mineral
        abundances in mixtures to within 5% absolute abundance; and
 
    (3) spatial resolution of <25 cm at 10 m distance (25 mrad)
        necessary to resolve and identify individual rocks 0.5 m in size
        or larger in the rover near field.
 
    The determination of atmospheric temperature profiles, aerosols,
    water vapor, condensates has two measurement requirements:
 
    (1) radiometric accuracy and precision necessary to determine the
        opacities of atmospheric dust and ice to +/-0.05 and temperature
        to +/-2 K; and
 
    (2) spectral resolution sufficient to uniquely identify dust,
        water-ice, water-vapor, and sound the atmosphere, and monitor
        their physical and compositional properties.
 
 
  Detectors
  =========
    The Mini-TES uses uncooled detectors to reduce the complexity of the
    fabrication, testing, operation, and rover interface of the
    instrument, while meeting the scientific requirements for the
    investigation. The Mini-TES has a single deuterated triglycine
    sulfate (DTGS) uncooled pyroelectric detector with proven space
    heritage that gives a spatial resolution of 20 mrad; an actuated
    field stop reduces the field of view to 8 mrad.
 
 
  Electronics
  ===========
    Mini-TES uses two Datel DC to DC power converters that accept +11 to
    +36 volts unregulated input voltage and supply +/-5 and +/-15 volts
    regulated output voltage. The Datel converters went through
    significant screening by Raytheon and NASA to validate them for use
    on the MER Mini-TES instruments.  The power converters are mounted
    on the same circuit card as the two SDL 80  mWatt 978 nm laser diode
    assemblies. These laser diodes have also been through significant
    screening for the Mini-TES instruments. The laser diodes are coupled
    into the optics via 1m fiber optic cables. The power connections to
    the spacecraft power bus are through the 21-pin Cannon micro-D
    flight connector located at the base of the Mini-TES interferometer
    baseplate.
 
    Mini-TES uses an uncooled DTGS pyroelectric detector with an
    integrated FET detector package. The bias voltage applied to the FET
    by the pre-amplifier ensures that the DTGS detector's crystals are
    properly poled when power is applied to the instrument.
    Pre-amplification and front-end filtering is performed on the
    preamplifier circuit board amplify the signal and to AC couple the
    detector output to block high frequency oscillations. A +/-12 volt
    regulator supplies power the detector and preamplifier electronics.
 
    The spectrometer circuit board performs the bulk of the analog
    electronics processing. The analog detector signal is passed through
    dual post-amplifier chains, performing the high-frequency boost,
    3-pole Bessel filtering, amplifier gain, and analog signal
    track/hold. The interferogram signal due to the scene is 'boosted'
    to account for the '1/f' roll-off of the detector response and is
    amplified to fill the 16-bit analog to digital converter.  The
    filtering is performed to achieve the desired IR signal bandpass of
    5 to 220 Hz. In addition, the analog signals from the two Hammamatsu
    silicone photodiode fringe signal detectors are passed through the
    fringe post-amplifier and fringe detection circuitry on the
    spectrometer board. The fringe detection electronics use a zero
    crossing comparator to generate the sampling pulse and the constant
    velocity servo feedback fringe clock. The amplified and filtered IR
    signal, fringe analog signal amplitude and the internal instrument
    analog telemetry is then fed into a 16:1 analog multiplexer followed
    by a 16-bit analog to digital converter. The 16-bit digital IR
    data are then transferred to the data buffer on the command and
    control circuit board for formatting and transfer to the Mini-TES
    interface electronics.
 
    The low level command, control and data flow tasks of the Mini-TES
    are controlled by logic in the command and control Field
    Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The interface electronics parse out
    the low level instrument command parameters that control various
    Mini-TES hardware functions. The Mini-TES command parameters are:
    interferometer motor on/off, amplifier gain high/low, amplifier
    chain primary/redundant, target (shutter) open/close, laser diode1
    on/off, laser heater2 on/off, start-of-scan optical switch
    primary/redundant, and laser heaters on/off.
 
    The flow of the digital interferometer data is controlled by
    additional logic in the command and control board FPGA. After each
    interferometer scan, the 16-bit interferogram data and 16-bit
    telemetry data are moved from the A/D to the input memory buffer on
    the 16-bit parallel data bus. These 16-bit parallel data are then
    sent to the digital multiplexer and serializer electronics where the
    three header words and fourteen digital telemetry words are
    serialized with the 16-bit IR data. The multiplexer, serializer and
    data formatting logic are included in the command and control FPGA.
    The three data header words include: 8-bit sync, 8-bit commanded
    parameter status, 16-bit scan count, and 16-bit interferogram
    sample count. The fourteen 16-bit telemetry words include:
    +5V power, -5V power, +15V power, -15V power, +10V power,
    -10V power,+12V power, -12V power, detector temperature, motor
    temperature, beamsplitter/optics temperature, laser diode1
    temperature, laser diode2 temperature, and fringe signal amplitude.
 
    The Mini-TES timing sequencing electronics are implemented in the
    command and control board FPGA. These electronics generate the
    timing waveforms necessary to control and synchronize instrument
    operation. The timing electronics provide the control and
    synchronization of the amplification, track/hold, multiplexing, and
    analog to digital conversion of the analog signals. They also
    control and synchronize the interferometer servo electronics with
    the data acquisitions. The timing sequencing electronics include the
    fringe delay electronics which are used to correct the sampling
    error due to the phase delays between the fringe and IR analog
    channels. All clocks in the timing sequencer are generated from the
    master clock crystal oscillator which operates  at a frequency of
    14.5152 MHz.
 
    The Mini-TES interferometer servo electronics are located on the
    command and control board and include the digital motor control
    logic and the analog servo drive electronics. The interferometer
    digital drive electronics, located in the FPGA, receive scan timing
    clocks from the timing sequencer electronics and the fringe clock
    from the fringe detection electronics. The motor control logic uses
    these clocks to synchronize the mirror movement with the
    spectrometer data acquisitions. The interferometer analog servo
    drive electronics generate the analog signals that control the
    movement of the TES interferometer moving mirror actuator. The
    moving mirror uses a direct drive Schaeffer linear motor with
    tachometer feedback. The moving mirror tachometer signal is returned
    to the interferometer control electronics to allow active feedback
    control of the actuator. The start of scan is monitored using
    primary and redundant single and double scan optical-interrupters
    that are connected to the moving mirror assembly.
 
 
  Optics
  ======
    The Mini-TES optical system uses a compact Cassegrain telescope
    configuration with a 6.35 mm diameter primary mirror that defines
    the system's aperture stop. Light reflects off the secondary mirror,
    forming the f/12 focal ratio.  The 1.12 cm diameter secondary
    obscures the clear aperture reducing the effective collection area.
    The use of baffles around the telescope housing and secondary mirror
    and the use of diffuse black paint around the optics and within the
    cavity minimizes stray light affects. An anti-reflection coated
    Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) window is located between the exit of the
    telescope's optical path and the entrance of the interferometer
    optical system. This window is tilted so that an internal etalon is
    not created between this surface and the beamsplitter. A flat mirror
    folds the radiance into the plane of the interferometer. All mirror
    surfaces are diamond-turned and gold-coated.
 
    Mini-TES utilizes the identical Michelson interferometer design as
    the TES instruments. The radiance from the main fold mirror passes
    through a 0.635 cm thick Potassium Bromide (KBr) beamsplitter and
    its amplitude is split in two and reflected/transmitted to each arm
    of the interferometer. This beamsplitter is installed in a radial
    3-point mount that allows the beamsplitter to maintain alignment
    over a 373 K operational range (223 K to 323 K). Due to the
    hydroscopic nature of KBr, a dry nitrogen purge during ground
    testing is required to maintain its transmission properties. In
    order to maintain positive purge without over-pressurization, the
    Mini-TES housing has a CdTe window, described above, an exhaust
    port, and check valve.
 
    A fixed mirror is in the reflected path of the interferometer, while
    a constant velocity moving mirror is in the transmission path. The
    moving mirror moves +/-0.25 mm to achieve the spectral sampling
    requirement of 10 cm-1. The wavefronts recombine at the beamsplitter
    and pass through a compensator of identical thickness to the
    beamsplitter to preserve the optical path difference.  This
    recombined radiance is directed by a fold mirror through the 20-mrad
    field stop towards the parabolic focus mirror. This mirror reimages
    the optical pupil onto the on-axis DTGS detector element, which is
    protected by thin (0.05 cm) chemical vapor deposited diamond window.

  Measured Parameters
  ===================
    The Mini-TES takes thermal infrared spectra of the target by viewing
    wavelenghts from 5 to 40 micrometers. The Mini-TES calibrated
    radiance is the primary data product for the MER mission. These data
    will be converted to effective emissivity and surface temperature by
    fitting a Planck blackbody function to the calibrated spectrum. The
    emissivity spectra will be converted to mineral abundance using a
    linear deconvolution model and a matrix of mineral spectra from the
    ASU Mineral Library and other sources. The derived surface
    temperature will be used to produce thermal inertia images via a
    thermal model, using data from multiple times of day where possible.
    Attempts will be made to coordinate these diurnal observations with
    the times of TES or THEMIS direct overflights, providing
    simultaneous temperature observations that can be extended to
    broader regions surrounding the rovers.]]></field>

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) will
    provide remote measurements of mineralogy and thermophysical
    properties of the scene surrounding the Mars Exploration Rovers,
    and guide the Rovers to key targets for detailed in situ
    measurements by other Rover experiments.  The Mini-TES is a
    Fourier Transform Spectrometer covering the spectral range
    5-29 micrometers (339.50 to 1997.06 cm-1) with a spectral sample
    interval of 9.99 cm-1. The Mini-TES telescope is a 6.35-cm diameter
    Cassegrain telescope that feeds a flat-plate Michelson moving
    mirror mounted on a voice-coil motor assembly. A single deuterated
    triglycine sulfate (DTGS) uncooled pyroelectric detector with
    proven space heritage gives a spatial resolution of 20 mrad; an
    actuated field stop can reduce the field of view to 8 mrad.
    Mini-TES is mounted within the Rover's Warm Electronics Box and
    views the terrain using its internal telescope looking up the hollow
    shaft of the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA) to the fixed fold mirror
    and rotating elevation scan mirror in the PMA head located ~1.5 m
    above the ground. The PMA provides a full 360 degree of azimuth
    travel and views from 30 degrees above the nominal horizon to 50
    degrees below. An interferogram is collected every two seconds, and
    transmitted to the Rover computer where the Fast Fourier Transform,
    spectral summing, lossless compression, and data formatting are
    performed prior to transmission to Earth. Radiometric calibration is
    provided by two calibration V-groove blackbody targets instrumented
    with platinum thermistor temperature sensors with absolute
    temperature calibration of +/-0.1 K. One calibration target is
    located inside the PMA head, the second is on the Rover deck. The
    Mini-TES temperature is expected to vary diurnally from 263 to 303
    K, with most surface composition data collected at scene
    temperatures >270 K. For these conditions the radiometric precision
    for two-spectra summing is +/-1.8 x10-8 W cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 between
    450 and 1500 cm-1, increasing to ~4.2 x10-8 W cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 at
    shorter (300 cm-1) and longer (1800 cm-1) wavenumbers. The absolute
    radiance error will be <5 x10-8 Watt cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1, decreasing to
    ~1 x10-8 Watt cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 over the wavenumber range where the
    scene temperature will be determined (1200-1600 cm-1). The
    worst-case sum of these random and systematic radiance errors
    correspond to an absolute temperature error of ~0.4 K for a true
    surface temperature of 270 K, and ~1.5 K for a surface at 180 K. The
    Mini-TES will be operated in a 20-mrad panorama mode and an 8-mrad
    targeted mode, producing 2-dimensional rasters and 3-dimensional
    hyperspectral image cubes of varying sizes. The overall Mini-TES
    envelope size is 23.5 cm x 16.3 cm x 15.5 cm and the mass is
    2.40 kg. The power consumption is 5.6 W average. The Mini-TES was
    developed by Arizona State University and Raytheon Santa Barbara
    Remote Sensing (SBRS).   Information in this instrument description
    is taken from The Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer for the
    Mars Exploration Rovers paper [CHRISTENSENETAL2003]. See this paper
    for more details.
 
 
  Scientific Objectives
  =====================
    The chief scientific objectives of the Mini-TES are:
 
    1) determine the mineralogy of rocks and soils, and
 
    2) determine the thermophysical properties of selected soil patches,
       and
 
    3) determine the temperature profile, dust opacity, water-ice
       opacity, and water vapor abundance in the lower boundary layer of
       atmosphere
 
 
  Calibration
  ===========
    The initial Mini-TES calibration and test was performed at SBRS
    prior to delivery to JPL, and a subset of these tests was performed
    on the integrated Mini-TES/PMA assembly. The objectives of these
    tests were to determine:
 
    (1) the field-of-view definition and alignment;
 
    (2) the out-of-field response;
 
    (3) the spectrometer spectral line shape and spectral sample
        position; and
 
    (4) the spectrometer radiometric calibration.
 
    Bench-level testing of the Mini-TES instrument was performed at SBRS
    in two phases. The first phase consisted of piece-part and
    system-level testing of the spectral performance of each sub-section
    under ambient conditions. The second phase consisted of field of
    view and out-of-field tests conducted before and after vibration and
    thermalvacuum testing to determine and confirm the instrument
    field-of-view and alignment. Mini-TES I was operated for a total of
    166 hours and Mini-TES II was operated for 594 hours at SBRS prior
    to initial delivery to JPL. The Mini-TES spectrometer, without the
    PMA, was tested and calibrated in vacuum at SBRS at instrument
    temperatures of -243, 263, 283, and 303 K. A matrix of calibration
    tests were performed viewing two precision calibration reference
    blackbody standards, one set at 223 K, 243 K, 263 K, and 283 K.
    While the second was varied at temperatures of 145 K, 190 K, 235 K,
    280 K, and 325 K. The Mini-TES/PMA systems were radiometrically
    calibrated in 6 mbar of nitrogen at instrument temperatures of 243,
    273, and 303 K over a range of calibration blackbody temperatures.
    These tests determined:
 
    (1) the emissivity and effective temperature of the internal
        reference surface;
 
    (2) the instrument response function and its variation with
        instrument temperature;
 
    (3) the absolute radiometric accuracy;
 
    (4) the spectrometer noise characteristics; and
 
    (5) the spectrometer gain values.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    The Mini-TES has many performance requirements, that if not met
    could significantly compromise the quality of the data obtained.
 
    Mineralogic mapping has three measurement requirements:
 
    (1) radiometric accuracy and precision necessary to uniquely
        determine the mineral abundances in mixtures to within 5%
        absolute abundance;
 
    (2) spectral resolution sufficient to uniquely determine the mineral
        abundances in mixtures to within 5% absolute abundance; and
 
    (3) spatial resolution of <25 cm at 10 m distance (25 mrad)
        necessary to resolve and identify individual rocks 0.5 m in size
        or larger in the rover near field.
 
    The determination of atmospheric temperature profiles, aerosols,
    water vapor, condensates has two measurement requirements:
 
    (1) radiometric accuracy and precision necessary to determine the
        opacities of atmospheric dust and ice to +/-0.05 and temperature
        to +/-2 K; and
 
    (2) spectral resolution sufficient to uniquely identify dust,
        water-ice, water-vapor, and sound the atmosphere, and monitor
        their physical and compositional properties.
 
 
  Detectors
  =========
    The Mini-TES uses uncooled detectors to reduce the complexity of the
    fabrication, testing, operation, and rover interface of the
    instrument, while meeting the scientific requirements for the
    investigation. The Mini-TES has a single deuterated triglycine
    sulfate (DTGS) uncooled pyroelectric detector with proven space
    heritage that gives a spatial resolution of 20 mrad; an actuated
    field stop reduces the field of view to 8 mrad.
 
 
  Electronics
  ===========
    Mini-TES uses two Datel DC to DC power converters that accept +11 to
    +36 volts unregulated input voltage and supply +/-5 and +/-15 volts
    regulated output voltage. The Datel converters went through
    significant screening by Raytheon and NASA to validate them for use
    on the MER Mini-TES instruments.  The power converters are mounted
    on the same circuit card as the two SDL 80  mWatt 978 nm laser diode
    assemblies. These laser diodes have also been through significant
    screening for the Mini-TES instruments. The laser diodes are coupled
    into the optics via 1m fiber optic cables. The power connections to
    the spacecraft power bus are through the 21-pin Cannon micro-D
    flight connector located at the base of the Mini-TES interferometer
    baseplate.
 
    Mini-TES uses an uncooled DTGS pyroelectric detector with an
    integrated FET detector package. The bias voltage applied to the FET
    by the pre-amplifier ensures that the DTGS detector's crystals are
    properly poled when power is applied to the instrument.
    Pre-amplification and front-end filtering is performed on the
    preamplifier circuit board amplify the signal and to AC couple the
    detector output to block high frequency oscillations. A +/-12 volt
    regulator supplies power the detector and preamplifier electronics.
 
    The spectrometer circuit board performs the bulk of the analog
    electronics processing. The analog detector signal is passed through
    dual post-amplifier chains, performing the high-frequency boost,
    3-pole Bessel filtering, amplifier gain, and analog signal
    track/hold. The interferogram signal due to the scene is 'boosted'
    to account for the '1/f' roll-off of the detector response and is
    amplified to fill the 16-bit analog to digital converter.  The
    filtering is performed to achieve the desired IR signal bandpass of
    5 to 220 Hz. In addition, the analog signals from the two Hammamatsu
    silicone photodiode fringe signal detectors are passed through the
    fringe post-amplifier and fringe detection circuitry on the
    spectrometer board. The fringe detection electronics use a zero
    crossing comparator to generate the sampling pulse and the constant
    velocity servo feedback fringe clock. The amplified and filtered IR
    signal, fringe analog signal amplitude and the internal instrument
    analog telemetry is then fed into a 16:1 analog multiplexer followed
    by a 16-bit analog to digital converter. The 16-bit digital IR
    data are then transferred to the data buffer on the command and
    control circuit board for formatting and transfer to the Mini-TES
    interface electronics.
 
    The low level command, control and data flow tasks of the Mini-TES
    are controlled by logic in the command and control Field
    Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The interface electronics parse out
    the low level instrument command parameters that control various
    Mini-TES hardware functions. The Mini-TES command parameters are:
    interferometer motor on/off, amplifier gain high/low, amplifier
    chain primary/redundant, target (shutter) open/close, laser diode1
    on/off, laser heater2 on/off, start-of-scan optical switch
    primary/redundant, and laser heaters on/off.
 
    The flow of the digital interferometer data is controlled by
    additional logic in the command and control board FPGA. After each
    interferometer scan, the 16-bit interferogram data and 16-bit
    telemetry data are moved from the A/D to the input memory buffer on
    the 16-bit parallel data bus. These 16-bit parallel data are then
    sent to the digital multiplexer and serializer electronics where the
    three header words and fourteen digital telemetry words are
    serialized with the 16-bit IR data. The multiplexer, serializer and
    data formatting logic are included in the command and control FPGA.
    The three data header words include: 8-bit sync, 8-bit commanded
    parameter status, 16-bit scan count, and 16-bit interferogram
    sample count. The fourteen 16-bit telemetry words include:
    +5V power, -5V power, +15V power, -15V power, +10V power,
    -10V power,+12V power, -12V power, detector temperature, motor
    temperature, beamsplitter/optics temperature, laser diode1
    temperature, laser diode2 temperature, and fringe signal amplitude.
 
    The Mini-TES timing sequencing electronics are implemented in the
    command and control board FPGA. These electronics generate the
    timing waveforms necessary to control and synchronize instrument
    operation. The timing electronics provide the control and
    synchronization of the amplification, track/hold, multiplexing, and
    analog to digital conversion of the analog signals. They also
    control and synchronize the interferometer servo electronics with
    the data acquisitions. The timing sequencing electronics include the
    fringe delay electronics which are used to correct the sampling
    error due to the phase delays between the fringe and IR analog
    channels. All clocks in the timing sequencer are generated from the
    master clock crystal oscillator which operates  at a frequency of
    14.5152 MHz.
 
    The Mini-TES interferometer servo electronics are located on the
    command and control board and include the digital motor control
    logic and the analog servo drive electronics. The interferometer
    digital drive electronics, located in the FPGA, receive scan timing
    clocks from the timing sequencer electronics and the fringe clock
    from the fringe detection electronics. The motor control logic uses
    these clocks to synchronize the mirror movement with the
    spectrometer data acquisitions. The interferometer analog servo
    drive electronics generate the analog signals that control the
    movement of the TES interferometer moving mirror actuator. The
    moving mirror uses a direct drive Schaeffer linear motor with
    tachometer feedback. The moving mirror tachometer signal is returned
    to the interferometer control electronics to allow active feedback
    control of the actuator. The start of scan is monitored using
    primary and redundant single and double scan optical-interrupters
    that are connected to the moving mirror assembly.

<field name="instrument_description"><![CDATA[The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph Subsystem (UVIS) is a set of telescopes
used to measure ultraviolet light from the Saturn system's atmospheres, rings,
and surfaces. The UVIS will also observe the fluctuations of starlight and
sunlight as the sun and stars move behind the rings and the atmospheres of
Titan and Saturn, and it will determine the atmospheric concentrations of
hydrogen and deuterium.
 
The following is a brief description of the components of the UVIS. For a
more detailed description, see [ESPOSITOETAL2005] and contained in the
DOCUMENT directory of this archive (pending permission).
 
The UVIS has two spectrographic channels: the extreme ultraviolet channel
and the far ultraviolet channel. The ultraviolet channels are built into
weight-relieved aluminum cases, and each contains a reflecting telescope, a
concave grating spectrometer, and an imaging, pulse-counting detector. The
UVIS also includes a high-speed photometer channel, a hydrogen-deuterium
absorption cell channel, and an electronic and control subassembly.
 
The extreme ultraviolet channel (EUV) will be used for imaging
spectroscopy and spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition
of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn. The EUV consists of a telescope with
a three-position slit changer, a baffle system, and a spectrograph with a
CODACON microchannel plate detector and associated electronics. The telescope
consists of an off-axis parabolic section with a focal length of 100 mm, a 22
mm by 30 mm aperture, and a baffle with a field of view of 3.67 degrees by
0.34 degrees. A precision mechanism positions one of the three entrance slits
at the focal plane of the telescope, each translating to a different spectral
resolution.
 
The spectrograph uses an aberration-corrected toroidal grating that
focuses the spectrum onto an imaging microchannel plate detector to achieve
both high sensitivity and spatial resolution along the entrance slit. The
microchannel plate detector electronics consist of a low-voltage power
supply, a programmable high-voltage power supply, charge-sensitive
amplifiers, and associated logic.
 
The EUV channel also contains a solar occultation mechanism to allow solar
flux to enter the telescope when the sun is still 20 degrees off-axis from
the primary telescope.
 
The far ultraviolet channel (FUV) will be used for imaging spectroscopy
and spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition of the
atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and of the rings. The FUV is similar to the
EUV channel except for the grating ruling density, optical coatings, and
detector details.  The FUV electronics are similar to those for the EUV
except for the addition of a high-voltage power supply for the ion pump.
 
The high-speed photometer channel (HSP) will perform stellar occultation
measurements of the structure and density of material in the rings. The HSP
resides in its own module and measures undispersed (zero-order) light from
its own parabolic mirror with a photomultiplier tube detector. The
electronics consist of a pulse-amplifier-discriminator and a fixed-level
high-voltage power supply.
 
The hydrogen-deuterium absorption cell channel (HDAC) will be used to
measure hydrogen and deuterium in the Saturn system using a hydrogen cell,
a deuterium cell, and a channel electron multiplier (CEM) detector to record
photons not absorbed in the cells. The hydrogen and deuterium cells are
resonance absorption cells filled with pure molecular hydrogen and deuterium,

<field name="description"><![CDATA[The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph Subsystem (UVIS) is a set of telescopes
used to measure ultraviolet light from the Saturn system's atmospheres, rings,
and surfaces. The UVIS will also observe the fluctuations of starlight and
sunlight as the sun and stars move behind the rings and the atmospheres of
Titan and Saturn, and it will determine the atmospheric concentrations of
hydrogen and deuterium.
 
The following is a brief description of the components of the UVIS. For a
more detailed description, see [ESPOSITOETAL2005] and contained in the
DOCUMENT directory of this archive (pending permission).
 
The UVIS has two spectrographic channels: the extreme ultraviolet channel
and the far ultraviolet channel. The ultraviolet channels are built into
weight-relieved aluminum cases, and each contains a reflecting telescope, a
concave grating spectrometer, and an imaging, pulse-counting detector. The
UVIS also includes a high-speed photometer channel, a hydrogen-deuterium
absorption cell channel, and an electronic and control subassembly.
 
The extreme ultraviolet channel (EUV) will be used for imaging
spectroscopy and spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition
of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn. The EUV consists of a telescope with
a three-position slit changer, a baffle system, and a spectrograph with a
CODACON microchannel plate detector and associated electronics. The telescope
consists of an off-axis parabolic section with a focal length of 100 mm, a 22
mm by 30 mm aperture, and a baffle with a field of view of 3.67 degrees by
0.34 degrees. A precision mechanism positions one of the three entrance slits
at the focal plane of the telescope, each translating to a different spectral
resolution.
 
The spectrograph uses an aberration-corrected toroidal grating that
focuses the spectrum onto an imaging microchannel plate detector to achieve
both high sensitivity and spatial resolution along the entrance slit. The
microchannel plate detector electronics consist of a low-voltage power
supply, a programmable high-voltage power supply, charge-sensitive
amplifiers, and associated logic.
 
The EUV channel also contains a solar occultation mechanism to allow solar
flux to enter the telescope when the sun is still 20 degrees off-axis from
the primary telescope.
 
The far ultraviolet channel (FUV) will be used for imaging spectroscopy
and spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition of the
atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and of the rings. The FUV is similar to the
EUV channel except for the grating ruling density, optical coatings, and
detector details.  The FUV electronics are similar to those for the EUV
except for the addition of a high-voltage power supply for the ion pump.
 
The high-speed photometer channel (HSP) will perform stellar occultation
measurements of the structure and density of material in the rings. The HSP
resides in its own module and measures undispersed (zero-order) light from
its own parabolic mirror with a photomultiplier tube detector. The
electronics consist of a pulse-amplifier-discriminator and a fixed-level
high-voltage power supply.
 
The hydrogen-deuterium absorption cell channel (HDAC) will be used to
measure hydrogen and deuterium in the Saturn system using a hydrogen cell,
a deuterium cell, and a channel electron multiplier (CEM) detector to record
photons not absorbed in the cells. The hydrogen and deuterium cells are
resonance absorption cells filled with pure molecular hydrogen and deuterium,
respectively. They are located between an objective lens and a detector. Both
cells are made of stainless steel coated with teflon and are sealed at each
end with MgF2 windows.  The electronics consist of a pulse-amplifier-
discriminator, a fixed-level high-voltage power supply, and two filament
current controllers.
 
The UVIS microprocessor electronics and control subassembly consists of
input-output elements, power conditioning, science data and housekeeping data
collection electronics, and microprocessor control elements.]]></field>

  ===================
 
    Launched on February 17, 1996, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous
    (NEAR) spacecraft will go into orbit around the asteroid 433 Eros on
    February 14, 2000. The first launch of the Discovery class missions,
    NEAR will study this S-class asteroid up close, determining its
    geological characteristics, physical properties and composition
    [CHENG1997]. The reflected-light spectral data gathered by the Near
    Infrared Spectrometer (NIS) is a key component of an integrated
    strategy for the study of Eros. This strategy also includes high
    resolution imaging from the multispectral imager (MSI)
    [VEVERKAETAL1997A], elemental abundance measurements from the
    X-ray/gamma-ray spectrometer (XGRS) [TROMBKAETAL1997B], magnetic
    field data from the magnetometer (MAG) [ACUNAETAL1997], topographic
    data from the NEAR laser rangefinder (NLR) [ZUBERETAL1997], and mass
    and gravity data from the on-board radio science experiment
    [YEOMANSETAL1997]. NIS will conduct spectral mapping of Eros by
    measuring reflected sunlight in the wavelength range from 800 to
    2600 nm. Reflectance spectra of Eros will be used to identify the
    surface mineral assemblages, to constrain the origin and evolution
    of the surface, and, in combination with other NEAR data, to explore
    the links between asteroids and meteorites.
 
    NEAR has traveled a circuitous path on its way to its orbital
    encounter with Eros [FARQUHARETAL1995], including a swing through
    the inner main asteroid belt that allowed a flyby of the C-type
    asteroid 253 Mathilde, a gravity-assist swingby of Earth, and an
    unplanned initial flyby of Eros itself following an aborted
    orbit-insertion burn [YEOMANSETAL1999], [VEVERKAETAL1999]. Due to
    inadequate power margins at the relatively large heliocentric
    distance during the target-of-opportunity encounter with Mathilde on
    June 27, 1997, NIS was not turned on at that time
    [VEVERKAETAL1997B]. The NIS instrument's protective cover was not
    opened until later in 1997, allowing observations of the on-board
    calibration target (caltarget) and of the Earth and Moon during the
    January 23, 1998 swingby maneuver. NIS first observed Eros in late
    December 1998 [VEVERKAETAL1999A]. Data from the Eros flyby provided
    a valuable opportunity to evaluate instrument performance.
    Observations of Eros will resume on final approach in early 2000 and
    continue throughout the mission as the orbit is changed in steps
    from 500 to 35 km radius.
 
    NIS was designed to fulfill four key NEAR measurement requirements
    [VEVERKAETAL1997A]:  1) Map the mineralogical composition of Eros
    using reflected sunlight 1) Map the distribution and abundance of
    minerals at scales as small as 300 meters 1) Complement high
    resolution MSI images and low resolution XGRS elemental distribution
    maps for definitive identification of rock types composing Eros'
    surface 1)  Provide information on the physical and textural
    properties of these surface materials
 
    In order to fulfill these requirements, the instrument's behavior
    must be characterized both from rigorous preflight calibration and
    testing and from in-flight observations over the mission lifetime.
    This paper reviews the data and techniques used to calibrate the
    NIS, and discusses initial in-flight results for observations by NIS
    during the cruise, Earth swingby, and Eros flyby phases of the NEAR
    mission. The calibration of the instrument will be refined
    throughout the mission. Table two in the NIS calibration paper contains
    the science rationale for the phases and can be found in the
    NIS/DOCUMENT/INSTRUMENT/CALPAPER directory.
 
 
  Instrument Description
  ========================
    NIS is composed of a grating infrared spectrometer, a scan mirror,
    two passively cooled detector modules, a mounting bracket,
    spectrometer electronics, and a data processing unit (DPU) that
    controls both the NIS and the NEAR magnetometer. NIS has a one-time
    deployable opaque cover, which was opened on September 24, 1997,
    three months after the Mathilde flyby [VEVERKAETAL1997B].
 
  Hardware
  --------
    The NIS design (Fig. 1) is copied from an earlier Applied Physics
    Laboratory (APL) spectrometer - the Defense Meteorological Satellite
    Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI) - and
    modified for an infrared wavelength range. [WARRENETAL1997] detail
    the design characteristics, engineering, and construction of the
    instrument. A gold-coated scan mirror controls the direction of
    viewing over a range of 140 degrees. Light reflected from the scan
    mirror passes through a 20 x 25-mm aperture stop and is imaged by a
    telescope mirror at a slit. The field of view is selectable at the
    slit to 'narrow' (0.38 degrees x 0.76 degrees) or 'wide' (0.76
    degrees x 0.76 degrees) settings. A shutter actuates the narrow
    slit, with the smaller slit opening coming down over the fixed wide
    slit. The two slits provide field-of-view sizes of 0.65 x 1.3 km or
    1.3 x 1.3 km from 100 km distance. A second shutter can be actuated
    to completely block the slit for dark current measurements. After
    passing through the slit, light is dispersed and re- imaged off a
    gold toroidal diffraction grating (a Rowland circle configuration
    spectrometer) and hits a dichroic beamsplitter mounted at 45 degrees
    to the beam which transmits or reflects the energy to fall on two
    32- element linear detector arrays. Reflected 2nd order wavelengths
    (804-1506 nm) fall on a germanium (Ge) array. Each Ge channel has a
    bandwidth of 21.6 nm.  The germanium detector has a selectable gain
    of 1x or 10x. Transmitted 1st order wavelengths (1348-2732 nm) go to
    an indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs) array with 43.1 nm channel
    bandwidth. [WARRENETAL1997] calibrated the central wavelengths of
    all NIS channels at three operational temperatures (-7 degrees C,
    -17 degrees C, and -23 degrees C) and found best-fit Ge spectral
    calibration given by:
 
    lambda (nm) = 794.6 + 21.61*n        (Equation 1)
 
    where n is Ge element number 1-32. The uncertainty of the wavelength
    calibration over the range of temperatures examined is +/-0.5 nm.
    InGaAs element center wavelengths are given by:
 
    lambda (nm) = 43.11*n - 50.8        (Equation 2)
 
    where n is InGaAs element number 33-64. The temperature-dependent
    wavelength uncertainty is approximately +/-3.5 nm.
 
    The lower two channels of the InGaAs detector (channels 33 and 34,
    at 1372 and 1315 nm respectively) are below the transition
    wavelength of the dichroic beamsplitter, and therefore always
    register very low signal. The upper 3 channels (channels 62-64 at
    2622, 2665, and 2708 nm) are near or in detector cutoff, making the
    effective upper bound for good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) around
    2500 nm for the signal level expected at Eros. Additionally, two
    InGaAs channels (47 and 57, at 1975 nm and 2406 nm) have been
    extremely noisy since manufacture and do not produce easily usable
    data. Default operations for NIS utilize the narrow slit, providing
    a critically sampled spectral resolution of 22 nm in the Ge
    detector, and 44 nm in the InGaAs detector. The wide slit
    configuration provides half the spectral resolution (44 nm and 88 nm
    respectively), but passes twice the light and therefore has a higher
    SNR.
 
    The NIS scan mirror can rotate the line of sight over 350 steps in
    0.4-degree increments in the spacecraft Z-X' plane. The +Z axis is
    perpendicular to the plane of NEAR's solar panels, and +X' is the
    boresight of the instruments.  Mirror position 0 (nominal caltarget
    observation geometry) is 30 degrees towards the Z-axis from the
    boresight. The boresight is aligned with mirror position 75.
    Position 300 points in the -Z (anti-Sun) direction.
 
    For optimum performance the detectors are operated near -35 degrees
    C, maintained by passive cooling or active heaters, depending on the
    thermal environment. A solar-illuminated gold calibration plaque
    (caltarget) is mounted to the instrument for radiometric stability
    calibration.  Table I summarizes the NIS specifications. More
    detailed descriptions of the NIS instrument design are presented in
    [PEACOCK1997] and [WARRENETAL1997].
 
  Flight Software
  ---------------
    In-flight NIS data are acquired through the use of command sequences
    to the instrument that specify ten instrument parameters
    [NISAPLSRS1995], [IZENBERGETAL1998] as follows:  1. Spectrometer
    sequence ID (0-15). Sixteen sequences can be uploaded and stored
    while the instrument is powered. Sequences 0, 1, and 2 are
    hard-coded, but can be redefined.  2. Repeats: the number of times
    the commanded observations will repeat.  3. Seconds between
    repeats.  4. Number of observations. This is the number taken during
    a single repeat of the sequence.  5. Calibration interval
    (1-65535).  Number of observations before acquisition of dark
    spectra. This is used to interleave shutter-closed dark observations
    with data observations.  6. Number of seconds to co-add spectral
    data in each observation (0-63).  7. Number of rest spectra (0-63).
    Used when interleaved darks are taken, between spectra acquisition
    and dark acquisition.  8. Number of co-added seconds of dark signal
    for interleaved dark spectrum.  9. Number of scan mirror steps
    between observations (sign indicates direction).  10. Seconds
    between observations.
 
    For the purposes of the software discussion, a 'spectrum' is the
    result of a one-second integration of the instrument as it gathers
    data.  An 'observation' is 0-63 consecutive one-second spectra
    summed together. The example sequence ( 15  3  5  10  5  16  2  4 2
    2 ) is interpreted as follows: Sequence ID is 15. The sequence will
    repeat three times, each iteration to contain 10 observations
    consisting of 16 co-added spectra of accumulated data. The
    calibration interval of five means that every 5th observation
    (numbers 5 and 10 in each repeat) will instead co-add 10 spectra of
    the target, then rest 2 seconds while the shutter closes, then take
    four co-added spectra of dark signal. After each accumulated
    observation, the scan mirror will move +2 steps and the instrument
    will rest two seconds. During each repeat, the mirror will move 20
    steps. Each repeat is separated by five seconds to allow the mirror
    to return to the start position. This example sequence would
    generate 30 NIS observations of the target, and 6 dark
    observations.  Choice of the wide or narrow NIS slit, the high or
    low Ge detector gain, and the starting NIS scan mirror position are
    specified through separate commands to the instrument.]]></field>

    Launched on February 17, 1996, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous
    (NEAR) spacecraft will go into orbit around the asteroid 433 Eros on
    February 14, 2000. The first launch of the Discovery class missions,

    and gravity data from the on-board radio science experiment
    [YEOMANSETAL1997]. NIS will conduct spectral mapping of Eros by
    measuring reflected sunlight in the wavelength range from 800 to
    2600 nm. Reflectance spectra of Eros will be used to identify the

    June 27, 1997, NIS was not turned on at that time
    [VEVERKAETAL1997B]. The NIS instrument's protective cover was not
    opened until later in 1997, allowing observations of the on-board

    December 1998 [VEVERKAETAL1999A]. Data from the Eros flyby provided
    a valuable opportunity to evaluate instrument performance.
    Observations of Eros will resume on final approach in early 2000 and

  Instrument Description
  ========================
    NIS is composed of a grating infrared spectrometer, a scan mirror,
    two passively cooled detector modules, a mounting bracket,
    spectrometer electronics, and a data processing unit (DPU) that
    controls both the NIS and the NEAR magnetometer. NIS has a one-time
    deployable opaque cover, which was opened on September 24, 1997,
    three months after the Mathilde flyby [VEVERKAETAL1997B].
 
  Hardware
  --------
    The NIS design (Fig. 1) is copied from an earlier Applied Physics
    Laboratory (APL) spectrometer - the Defense Meteorological Satellite
    Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI) - and
    modified for an infrared wavelength range. [WARRENETAL1997] detail
    the design characteristics, engineering, and construction of the
    instrument. A gold-coated scan mirror controls the direction of
    viewing over a range of 140 degrees. Light reflected from the scan
    mirror passes through a 20 x 25-mm aperture stop and is imaged by a
    telescope mirror at a slit. The field of view is selectable at the
    slit to 'narrow' (0.38 degrees x 0.76 degrees) or 'wide' (0.76
    degrees x 0.76 degrees) settings. A shutter actuates the narrow
    slit, with the smaller slit opening coming down over the fixed wide
    slit. The two slits provide field-of-view sizes of 0.65 x 1.3 km or
    1.3 x 1.3 km from 100 km distance. A second shutter can be actuated
    to completely block the slit for dark current measurements. After
    passing through the slit, light is dispersed and re- imaged off a
    gold toroidal diffraction grating (a Rowland circle configuration
    spectrometer) and hits a dichroic beamsplitter mounted at 45 degrees
    to the beam which transmits or reflects the energy to fall on two
    32- element linear detector arrays. Reflected 2nd order wavelengths
    (804-1506 nm) fall on a germanium (Ge) array. Each Ge channel has a
    bandwidth of 21.6 nm.  The germanium detector has a selectable gain
    of 1x or 10x. Transmitted 1st order wavelengths (1348-2732 nm) go to
    an indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs) array with 43.1 nm channel
    bandwidth. [WARRENETAL1997] calibrated the central wavelengths of
    all NIS channels at three operational temperatures (-7 degrees C,
    -17 degrees C, and -23 degrees C) and found best-fit Ge spectral
    calibration given by:
 
    lambda (nm) = 794.6 + 21.61*n        (Equation 1)
 
    where n is Ge element number 1-32. The uncertainty of the wavelength
    calibration over the range of temperatures examined is +/-0.5 nm.
    InGaAs element center wavelengths are given by:
 
    lambda (nm) = 43.11*n - 50.8        (Equation 2)
 
    where n is InGaAs element number 33-64. The temperature-dependent
    wavelength uncertainty is approximately +/-3.5 nm.
 
    The lower two channels of the InGaAs detector (channels 33 and 34,
    at 1372 and 1315 nm respectively) are below the transition
    wavelength of the dichroic beamsplitter, and therefore always
    register very low signal. The upper 3 channels (channels 62-64 at
    2622, 2665, and 2708 nm) are near or in detector cutoff, making the
    effective upper bound for good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) around
    2500 nm for the signal level expected at Eros. Additionally, two
    InGaAs channels (47 and 57, at 1975 nm and 2406 nm) have been
    extremely noisy since manufacture and do not produce easily usable
    data. Default operations for NIS utilize the narrow slit, providing
    a critically sampled spectral resolution of 22 nm in the Ge
    detector, and 44 nm in the InGaAs detector. The wide slit
    configuration provides half the spectral resolution (44 nm and 88 nm
    respectively), but passes twice the light and therefore has a higher
    SNR.
 
    The NIS scan mirror can rotate the line of sight over 350 steps in
    0.4-degree increments in the spacecraft Z-X' plane. The +Z axis is
    perpendicular to the plane of NEAR's solar panels, and +X' is the
    boresight of the instruments.  Mirror position 0 (nominal caltarget
    observation geometry) is 30 degrees towards the Z-axis from the
    boresight. The boresight is aligned with mirror position 75.
    Position 300 points in the -Z (anti-Sun) direction.
 
    For optimum performance the detectors are operated near -35 degrees
    C, maintained by passive cooling or active heaters, depending on the
    thermal environment. A solar-illuminated gold calibration plaque
    (caltarget) is mounted to the instrument for radiometric stability
    calibration.  Table I summarizes the NIS specifications. More
    detailed descriptions of the NIS instrument design are presented in
    [PEACOCK1997] and [WARRENETAL1997].
 
  Flight Software
  ---------------
    In-flight NIS data are acquired through the use of command sequences
    to the instrument that specify ten instrument parameters
    [NISAPLSRS1995], [IZENBERGETAL1998] as follows:  1. Spectrometer
    sequence ID (0-15). Sixteen sequences can be uploaded and stored
    while the instrument is powered. Sequences 0, 1, and 2 are
    hard-coded, but can be redefined.  2. Repeats: the number of times
    the commanded observations will repeat.  3. Seconds between
    repeats.  4. Number of observations. This is the number taken during
    a single repeat of the sequence.  5. Calibration interval
    (1-65535).  Number of observations before acquisition of dark
    spectra. This is used to interleave shutter-closed dark observations
    with data observations.  6. Number of seconds to co-add spectral
    data in each observation (0-63).  7. Number of rest spectra (0-63).
    Used when interleaved darks are taken, between spectra acquisition
    and dark acquisition.  8. Number of co-added seconds of dark signal
    for interleaved dark spectrum.  9. Number of scan mirror steps
    between observations (sign indicates direction).  10. Seconds
    between observations.
 
    For the purposes of the software discussion, a 'spectrum' is the
    result of a one-second integration of the instrument as it gathers
    data.  An 'observation' is 0-63 consecutive one-second spectra
    summed together. The example sequence ( 15  3  5  10  5  16  2  4 2
    2 ) is interpreted as follows: Sequence ID is 15. The sequence will
    repeat three times, each iteration to contain 10 observations
    consisting of 16 co-added spectra of accumulated data. The
    calibration interval of five means that every 5th observation
    (numbers 5 and 10 in each repeat) will instead co-add 10 spectra of
    the target, then rest 2 seconds while the shutter closes, then take
    four co-added spectra of dark signal. After each accumulated
    observation, the scan mirror will move +2 steps and the instrument
    will rest two seconds. During each repeat, the mirror will move 20
    steps. Each repeat is separated by five seconds to allow the mirror
    to return to the start position. This example sequence would
    generate 30 NIS observations of the target, and 6 dark
    observations.  Choice of the wide or narrow NIS slit, the high or

  ===================
 
    The MECA instrument suite on the Phoenix spacecraft returns 15
    distinct unchannelized telemetry types, of which three are common to
    all the component instruments (microscopes, chemistry laboratories, and
    thermal and electrical properties probe). These are types 4
    (CME_STATUS), 5 (POWER_DATA), and 6 (TABLES).
 
    Type 4 is a direct response from the FPGA that controls all aspects
    of MECA operations. The most common usage of this telemetry type is as
    a reply to routine requests including turning on LEDs for imaging,
    moving the microscope sample stage, deploying a chemistry actuator
    (sample drawer, water release, or stirring motor), or simply a status
    inquiry. The data return provides not only confirmation that the
    requested operation occurred, but specific information necessary for
    calibration, such as the position of the stage when the atomic force
    microscope is engaged. A second usage of this telemetry type is in
    response to a 'raw' command, a direct instruction to the FPGA to execute
    any of its allowed functions. While not recommended for routine science
    measurements, this mode is often used for operations that are not
    performed in the desired sequence by the standard flight software
    commands. Notably, this may include voltammetry and potentiometry
    measurements in the chemistry cells, in which case the Type 4 return
    contains primary science data.
 
    Type 5 data returns the voltage and current provided by the primary
    MECA 5V (load and logic) and 15V (load and AFM) power supplies. These
    results are diagnostic of the functioning of all subsystems and should
    be indicative of many anomalous conditions.
 
    Type 6 data returns, on request, the contents of any of six tables
    that modify the operation of the MECA flight software (FSW). These
    include a state table which is autonomously maintained by FSW as well
    as several tables that can only be set by explicit user command. These
    user-maintained tables contain the values and allowed ranges of
    parameters and attributes that define the implementation of each
    experiment. For microscopy, for example, they might define the
    different substrate positions on the sample wheel as well as the
    optimal focus position. Download of these latter tables is for the
    purpose of confirmation that the actual parameters of an experiment
    were set as intended.

<field name="instrument_description"><![CDATA[Instrument Overview
  ===================
   The Lunar Prospector Engineering 'instrument' consists of the
   spacecraft attitude control system (ACS), the command and data
   handling (CDH) subsystem, and the communications subsystem (COM).
   Various data products from each of the systems have been included in
   the archive of the NASA level 0 data [BINDERETAL1998].
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The engineering systems support science rather than acquire science
    data. The individual systems were designed to meet the accuracy
    requirements of the science payload.
 
 
  Platform Mounting Descriptions
  ==============================
    The communications antenna is mounted along the spacecraft spin axis
    (+Z). The sun pulse and limb crossing sensor mounting locations were
    not provided to the archive.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    The instantaneous spin rate varies as the spacecraft passes into and
    out of the Moon's shadow and after each spacecraft maneuver. When the
    spacecraft is in eclipse, the sun pulse is estimated using the
    pre-eclipse measured spin rate, the calibrated spin rate change
    during eclipse, and limb sensor telemetry.
 
  Operation and Sampling Modes
  ============================
    The communication system consists of an S-band transponder, an omni
    antenna with 3-pi steradian antenna pattern for uplink and downlink,
    and a medium gain antenna for downlink.  The engineering-only
    downlink data rate is 300 bps and the science/engineering downlink
    data rate is 3600 bps.
 
    Command and control of the spacecraft is achieved by a simple Command
    and Data Handling (C&DH) unit.  As an individual command is uplinked
    to the spacecraft, the C&DH directs the command to the appropriate
    subsystem.  All science and engineering data are collected by the
    C&DH and then are buffered and formatted for downlink by the C&DH.
    The data are downlinked at 1800 bps immediately and simultaneously
    dumped into a solid state recorder.  The data stored on the solid
    state recorder is downlinked 53 minutes later.  These delayed data
    frames are interleaved into the real-time data stream, yielding a
    total downlink rate of 3600 bps.  The purpose of the delayed stream
    is to receive data acquired during communications blackout periods
    and to eliminate the need for a commandable data recorder.
 
    The ACS system consists of sun and limb crossing sensors. The data
    from these sensors is used to determine the spacecraft attitude and
    spin rate.
 
 
  Principal Investigator
  ======================
    The LP science team consists of the PI, Alan Binder and six Co-I's,
    and is divided into three groups.  The Spectrometer Group consists of
    William Feldman, Binder, and G. Scott Hubbard.  The Magnetics Group
    consists of Robert Lin, Mario Acuna, and Lon Hood.  The Gravity Group
    consists of Alexander Konopliv.]]></field>

    frames are interleaved into the real-time data stream, yielding a
    total downlink rate of 3600 bps.  The purpose of the delayed stream
    is to receive data acquired during communications blackout periods
    and to eliminate the need for a commandable data recorder.
 
    The ACS system consists of sun and limb crossing sensors. The data
    from these sensors is used to determine the spacecraft attitude and
    spin rate.

INTRODUCTION
 
     Jupiter possesses the largest planetary magnetosphere in the
solar system.  It is the largest in spatial dimension, has the highest
trapped particle energies and intensities, has the greatest
compositional variety in its major particle populations, displays the
largest co-rotational effects and has the largest number of moons
within the magnetosphere that provide both strong sources for and
losses of the observed particle populations.  These characteristics,
uncovered by the Pioneer and Voyager flybys demand an instrument
design capable of accommodating the great range in parametric values
established by these extremes.
 
     Within the Jovian magnetosphere, the energetic (>=20 keV)
particle populations play an important dual role.  First, they
represent a major factor in determining the size, shape, and dynamics
of the system.  For example, observations of energetic particle
intensities and corresponding energy densities show that these
populations are important in (1) standing off the solar wind and
thereby determining magnetopause position; (2) determining the general
magnetic field configuration in the evening magnetosphere and (3)
establishing the bulk of the ring current responsible for the
magnetodisk configuration of the middle-Jovian magnetosphere.
 
     Secondly the energetic particles play an important diagnostic
role in the determination of energization, transport, and loss
processes active in the Jovian magnetosphere.  In this role they also
provide a remote sensing capability for identifying magnetospheric
structures through finite gyroradius effects and for diagnosing remote
processes through field-aligned flow, E x B drift, and magnetic drift
effects.
 
     The Galileo EPD will provide major extensions to the Jovian
energetic particle data base obtained from the Pioneer and Voyager
flybys.  For example:
(1)  Galileo will be placed into a highly elliptical orbit around
Jupiter.  The nominal two-year mission lifetime will allow both a
direct measure of time variations in the Jovian magnetosphere and a
significantly larger spatial sample of the system than has been
possible with the previous flybys.
(2) The nominal mission includes several close ( < 1000 km) flybys of
the Galilean satellites thereby providing the best opportunity to date
to observe details of the satellite/magnetospheric interactions.
(3)  The EPD provides the first 4-pi steradian angular coverage for
Jovian energetic particles, thereby assuring that the necessary
energetic particle measurements will be obtained independent of
satellite orientation and magnetic field direction.
(4)  The low-energy thresholds of the EPD effectively close the energy
gap between plasma and energetic particle measurements that has
existed in previous observations and assures that processes thought to
operate in that gap will be tested by direct observation.  For
example, it has been suggested that the particles powering Jovian
aurora are ions of energies <=100 keV/nucl, a composition energy range
to be measured by Galileo instrumentation at Jupiter.
 
EPD OVERVIEW
 
     The EPD instrument is the result of a joint effort between The
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), The
Max-Planck-Institute fur Aeronomie (MPAe) and The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration Space Environment Laboratory (NOAA/SEL).
Proposed in 1976 with initial funds received in late 1977, the EPD was
launched onboard the Galileo spacecraft on October 12, 1989.  The MPAe
was responsible for the detector heads and three analog circuit boards
associated with those heads.  The NOAA/SEL was responsible for the
original time-of-flight (TOF) circuitry.  The TOF circuitry employed
in the upgraded TOF detector actually flown (and described in the
composition measurement system, CMS, section) was the joint
responsibility of MPAe and JHU/APL.  The JHU/APL was responsible for
all remaining electronics, the scanning motor, the data system,
instrument power, structure test, instrument integration, and
spacecraft integration.  Calibrations were performed by JHU/APL and
MPAe.
     The general characteristics of the EPD are listed in the
following table:

0.01-15        Iron
0.015-11  Electrons
 
64 rate channels plus pulse height analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
     The two bi-directional solid-state detector telescopes are the
Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS) and the
Composition Measurement System (CMS).  These detector heads are
mounted on a platform and rotated by a stepper motor contained in the
main electronics box.  The combination of the satellite spin and the
stepper motor rotation (nominally stepping to the next position after
each spacecraft spin) provides 4 pi steradian coverage of the unit
sphere.  The 0 degree ends of the two telescopes have a clear field of
view over the unit sphere and also can be positioned behind a
foreground shield/source holder for background measurements and
in-flight calibrations.  The 180 degree ends experience obscuration
effects in motor positions 4, 5, and 6 caused by the magnetometer boom
and foreground shield.
     The zero degree end of the LEMMS unit uses magnetic deflection
to separate electrons from ions and provides, from detectors A and B,
total-ion energy above ~20keV and from detectors E1, E2 and F1, F2
electron spectra above ~15keV.  The 180 degree end of LEMMS uses
absorbers in combination with detectors C and D to provide
measurements of ions >~16Mev and electrons >~2Mev.
     The zero degree end of the CMS telescope employs a
time-of-flight (TOF) versus total energy technique to measure
elemental energy spectra above ~10keV/nucl for helium through iron.  A
sweeping magnet in the entrance collimator prevents electrons with
energies <~256keV from entering the system.  TOF start and stop pulses
are generated as the incoming ions pass, respectively, through a thin
entrance foil and impinge on the detector KT.  Electrons released from
the foil and the detector are accelerated and deflected through a
series of grids and are detected by the microchannel places, MCP1 and
MCP2.  The time difference between the start pulse, MCP1, and the stop
pulse, MCP2, is then obtained, along with the ion total energy from
KT.  Knowing the ion total energy and its travel time through the
system (which gives its velocity), the ion mass is determined.
     The 180 degree end of the CMS telescope measures the ion
energy loss, deltaE, as the ions pass through detectors Ja and Jb and
the ion residual energy E=E(total) - deltaE, as they impact detectors
Ka and Kb.  The resulting deltaE and E measurement provides a measure
of ion composition for energies >~200keV/nucl.
     The planned normal mode of EPD operation is to have both the
telescopes powered and to step the stepper platform once each
satellite spin.  This will yield a 4-pi scan of the unit sphere
approximately every 140s.  Many other scanning modes are available and
will be used for special circumstances.  For example, during satellite
encounters, the EPD will be configured to scan particular directions
such as the expected direction of the magnetic flux tube, the
direction of the Galilean satellite wakes as they travel through the
Jovian magnetosphere, and the direction of the E x B drift paths.

Phase 2 Implications of LGA Mission for EPD:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
     In its normal mode EPD uses 912 bps to transmit 64 rate channels,
with time resolution of 1/3, 2/3, or 4/3 seconds. The S/C spin period
is ~20 seconds and the EPD motor moves to a new polar angle every spin.
Ground processing converts this time based data stream into displays
with 7 polar angles and 64, 32, or 16 azimuthal sectors.  The LRS
record mode will still provide this resolution of coverage.
 
In the LGA mission EPD was allocated bit rates of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or
40 bps, depending on S/C TM format. The lowest bit rates will be the
most common.
 
At these low rates the EPD measurements must be sectored on board the
S/C, and accumulated for extended periods. The challenge was to design
a realizable combination of channels, time and angular resolution that
fits the available bit rate and maximizes science return.
 
 
EPD LGA Science Mission Design:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction
 
The EPD collects particle flux measurements from almost the entire 4-pi
sphere by making and reporting fairly rapid particle measurements as the
spacecraft and the EPD motor platform sweep the EPD sensors through the
sky. The instrument simultaneously samples the particle flux in a number
of energy ranges, and sorts the particles out by mass, energy, and
direction.
 
It is important to preserve the directional information on the particle
measurements, as well as the mass and energy information. While the
temporal variations are also important to the science team, they are of
lower priority. In considering any new telemetry scheme, therefore, it
is necessary to preserve the mass, energy, and direction information.
 
Ideally, the EPD instrument could adapt to the reduced telemetry
allocations by doing on-board data averaging, editing, compression, etc.
Unfortunately, the version 1&2 software telemetry formats are
time-based, and do not easily support theses types of operations without
eliminating the directional information. It will therefore be necessary
to redesign the telemetry format such that it is spin-based; such an
approach allows data from adjacent spins to be averaged together, thus
reducing the bit rate required to send down the results.
 
It was determined that the EPD already contains sufficient hardware and
software resources necessary to handle the new tasks required of it,
however the rate channel RAM buffer storage requirements far exceed what
could be made available in the instrument. This single result drives
most of the interface requirements that will be presented below.
 
A number of cooperative EPD+CDS processing approaches have been looked
at with an eye to keeping as many tasks and storage buffers in the EPD
as possible. To generate a useful EPD data set, it will be necessary to
transfer raw rate channel data to the CDS, where it will be summed into
appropriate sector-based 4-byte counters. These counters will be
log-compressed, formatted, and passed on to the CDS telemetry processor
at the end of each instrument cycle.
 
 
2. Software Versions
 
The EPD instrument software has undergone a number of changes of the
course of the mission development cycle. The original instrument
software was finalized in about 1980, and was committed to ROM
fabricated by Sandia National Labs. This  software version, which I'll
refer to as the 'Version1' software, is still in the flight
instrument.
 
Prior to the original launch date of 1986, a few minor bugs were
discovered in the  software, and several small RAM patches were designed
to correct the problems. These  patches were tested in SAF during the
original integration checkout, but were never flown.
 
After the Challenger disaster, the EPD hardware underwent a number of
major modifications to support the addition of a new CMS TOF sensor.
Included in these modifications was the addition of a high voltage power
supply. New software was needed to operate the high voltage power
supply, reformat the telemetry output, and control enables, etc. The
software also included corrections to the minor bugs in the original
code. This software version, which I'll refer to as the 'Version2'
software, was to be the standard operating code for the 1989 mission. It
is important to note that if the REV2 software patch is not loaded, the
instrument reverts to the Rev1 (ROM- based) software. In this mode, the
instrument performs 99% of its intended functions, with the exception
that the high voltage supply (and thus the CMS TOF) can not be used.
This mode was used at Venus, Gaspra, and Ida.
 
The S-band mission will require us to greatly modify the way the EPD
collects and formats telemetry. New EPD software must be written to
enable the EPD to perform a number of new tasks. This software will work
closely with new software in the CDS which will collect and average the
EPD rate readouts. I will refer to the combined new real-time mode EPD
and CDS software as the 'Version3' version software.
 
There will be periods during the Galileo mission (such as satellite
encounters) when the CDS will collect data at the old, HGA-based rates.
After the data will be put on the tape recorded for later playback, the
system will revert back to the standard S-band collection scheme. A
requirement for the new Version3 software, therefore, is that it be
easily backward-compatible. By this I mean that it should be relatively
painless to quickly switch from the old HGA-based software to the new
Rev3 software.
 
When the instrument is put back into the record mode, we will want the
capability to operate the full instrument, i.e. the CMS TOF and high
voltage supply. It would therefore be desirable to have the ability to
switch from the Version3 software to the previous Version2 software. It
is not clear that we would want or be able to use all of the features
that were included in the Version2 software, however. We will therefore
modify the previous Version2 software for use with the LGA mission. This
version, which I'll refer to as the 'Version4' software, will handle
many of the same tasks as the Version2 software, but may not have all
the 'bells and whistles' in order to make the code more compact.
 
To summarize the material above:
 
EPD Software  Description
Version1      Original ROM-based code
Version2      Code generated for 1989 HGA mission
Version3      New real-time mode telemetry rate code for LGA-based
              mission
Version4      New record mode telemetry rate code for LGA-based mission
 
 
3. Science Background
 
The EPD instrument combines the output of two fairly independent sensor
subsystems, the LEMMS sensor and the CMS sensor. Two types of data are
produced by each of these sensors: rate channel data (channel counters)
and PHA (single event pulse height analysis) data. The science telemetry
is made up of rate channel and PHA data from both sensors.
 
The EPD science team has evaluated the scientific priorities from the
instrument in the context of a telemetry-starved SBAND environment. The
minimum spatial and temporal resolution requirements were determined for
each measurement; measurements with similar requirements were then
grouped together. A strawman telemetry format was then created by
trading off the projected telemetry and memory allocations for the EPD
vs. The science return from the measurements.
 
For the Version3 telemetry format, we decided to report all the CMS TOF
sensor rate channel measurements and selected PHA events. The LEMMS rate
channels measurements were also preserved. None of the CMS Delta-E x E
sensor measurements or LEMMS PHA spectral measurements were kept,
 however, except for LRS periods.
 
3.1 Spatial Resolution
 
The EPD motor was intended to quickly move the EPD sensor view angle
between 8 defined positions. These positions, called motor positions
(sometimes motor sectors) are numbered from 0 to 7, and are nominally 30
degrees apart. The calibrate position, 0 , is the exception, and is 45
 degrees away from position 1.
 
Unit sphere coverage for the EPD's sensors is provided by combining the
EPD motor stepping and the motion of the spacecraft spin. In the
original telemetry design, most rate channels were read and reported via
telemetry at least 15 times in each motor position (20 seconds). These
measurements were repeated in each of the 8 motor positions, yielding
120 spatial measurements per channel across the unit sphere.
 
Unfortunately, this type of spatial resolution will not be possible in
the Version3 software. To create the broader spatial sectors needed to
maintain some directional information on the particle fluxes while
conserving bit-rate, we divided the spacecraft spin into four 90-degree
sectors, and used the motor stepping pattern between positions 0 and 6
(7 will not be used). This reduces the original 120 sectors to only 28
sectors (4 spin sectors x 7 motor positions).
 
To reduce the bit-rate further, these 28 sectors will be summed together
using one of three algorithms. These algorithms will be used to produce
sector patterns which we'll call the 'high,' 'low,' and 'omni'
spatial resolution channel types. The unit sphere will now be divided
into either 17, 7, or 2 'super' sectors; each of these was the result
of summing one or more sectors together.
 
Each of the rate channels will be assigned to use one of these three
channel type formats; the more important the channel's data, the higher
the resolution it is given.
 
3.2 Motor Stepping
 
The EPD motor movement is directed primarily by the motor controller
board, and its associated processor hardware and software. The motor
controller is a slave to the data system board; its commands are
generated by and/or received from the data system, and its status is
sent to the data system.
 
As its name implies, the motor controller board handles all low level
motor control functions. It determines direction, stepping pattern,
position measurement, etc., and generates the actual motor phase pulses
that move the motor. Each time an electrical pulse is sent to the motor,
it will take a 'step' of 1.8 degrees. A series of pulses, sent over
about 1/2 second, is normally used to move the motor from one motor
position to the next.
 
The overall, high-level timing of the motor, however, is dictated by
the data system; it generates motor 'trigger' signals that tell the
motor controller when to initiate a motor movement. In the original
 design, the motor triggers are sent once every 20 seconds, but this
 timing can be altered via the 'motor dwell' command.
 
The motor trigger should be viewed as a timing synchronization signal,
not a command to move. When the motor controller receives the motor
trigger, its processor examines what stepping mode it is presently
executing. If the motor had been commanded to cease scan or stop at a
particular sector, the motor will do nothing in response to the motor
trigger; it will initiate a motor movement only if the commanded
stepping mode requires one.
 
In the new Version3 software, the data system will synchronize the motor
movement to the spacecraft spin by generating a motor trigger at the
 beginning of each spin of the spacecraft. The data system will use the
 CDS-supplied AACS spin vector information to determine when a new spin
has started. The motor controller interface will remain the same in that
it will simply respond to motor triggers using its original software.
 
The motor system operates in a 'windshield wiper' mode; it rotates 235
degrees in one direction, then reverses itself and goes back 235 degrees
in the opposite direction. Within this 235 degree rotational space,
there are 8 predefined, discrete motor positions, numbered 0 through 7.
In the Record Mode, the motor will visit all 8 positions, moving once
every 20 seconds from one position to the next (the actual motor
movement requires approximately 1/2 second).
 
In the Real-time Mode, the motor will only visit 7 of the 8 positions;
position number 7 is not used. The motor stepping will be synchronized
to the spacecraft spin rate, moving once per spin when the spacecraft
spin vector passes through 0. The motor movement synchronization is good
to 1/3 second resolution, resulting in approximately 6 degree
uncertainty. More information on the Real-time motor movements is
included in later sections of this document.
 
3.3 Temporal Resolution
 
As stated before, most EPD channels were previously read out once every
4/3 seconds. In the Version3 telemetry format, the channel read outs
will vary depending on what the EPD telemetry allocation is. The higher
the bit-rate, the higher the time resolution that will be used.
 
A new EPD data construct, called the EPD science record, will be used to
group the science measurements together. A science record will extend
over a number of spacecraft rotations; the sectorized rate channel data
in the record will be averaged across the multiple spins.
 
An EPD science record period will always be an integer multiple of EPD
cycles, where a motor cycle is defined as 6 EPD motor position steps.
Since the EPD motor will be synchronized to move once per spacecraft
spin, a motor cycle is 6 equal to spacecraft spin periods. Assuming a
nominal spin rate of 3.15 rpm, the nominal spin period is 19.048
seconds. Our minimum science record is one motor cycle (114.29 seconds)
and our maximum is 6 motor cycles (685.71 seconds or 11.4 minutes).
 
Worst-case time resolution chosen to be ~12 minutes (at 5 bps). This
should be reasonable--much of the Voyager analysis was done with 15
minute averages. Higher resolution will be available at the higher bit
rates. Angular resolution chosen to cover 4 Pie steradians with 1, 6, or
 16 measurements (and cal).
 
As described above, each rate channel is assigned to use one of the
three channel type formats. If these assignments were frozen, however,
it would not be possible to make good use of the variable bit-rate
allocated to the EPD. For this reason, two different mappings of rate
channel to channel type assignment will be used. These mappings will be
referred to as Channel Map 1 and Channel Map 2. The proposed channel
mappings are shown in Tables below. 3.4 Channel Bins
 
The combination of a rate channel and its channel map will create rate
channel 'bins.' The number of bins assigned to a rate channel can be
determined by looking at the number of readouts made in the unit sphere
for the channel; this is defined by which rate channel type the rate
channel is mapped to. To clarify, I'll give an example:
 
The LEMMS rate channel 'A4' is assigned to the a 'low' channel type
under Channel Map 1, and a 'high' channel type under Channel Map 2.
 Since a 'low' channel type incorporates 7 readouts across the unit
 sphere, there will be 7 bins assigned to A4 when the EPD bit rate
allocation dictates the use of Channel Map 1. Similarly, there will be
17 bins assigned to A4 when the EPD bit rate allocation dictates the use
of Channel Map 2.
 
By totaling up the number of bins assigned to each rate channel in the
two channel maps, we determine that under Channel Map 1, there will be
167 CMS bins and 189 LEMMS bins, for a total of 356 bins. Under Channel
Map 2, there will be a 202 CMS bins and 249 LEMMS bins, for a total of
451 bins.
 
It is important to remember that the counts that go into these bins are
generated by the instrument across many spacecraft spins, and the bins
are written to in a quasi random fashion, based on where the spacecraft
spin vector is pointing and what motor position the EPD is in. This
means that the data contained in these bins must be stored somewhere
throughout the science record, not just when a channel is being read.
 
The EPD rate channel accumulators each contain 24 bits counters, thus a
maximum count of 2^24=16,777,216 can be held in each accumulator before
it will role-over. If the bin is to be read once every science record,
(maximum time of 685.71 seconds long), a 24 bit bin can only handle an
average count rate of only about 24K counts/sec. Some of the LEMMS and
CMS rate channels should produce counts are rates above 200K per second.
For this reason, at least some of the bins must be 4 bytes long to
handle the expected range.

INTRODUCTION
 
     Jupiter possesses the largest planetary magnetosphere in the
solar system.  It is the largest in spatial dimension, has the highest
trapped particle energies and intensities, has the greatest
compositional variety in its major particle populations, displays the
largest co-rotational effects and has the largest number of moons
within the magnetosphere that provide both strong sources for and
losses of the observed particle populations.  These characteristics,
uncovered by the Pioneer and Voyager flybys demand an instrument
design capable of accommodating the great range in parametric values
established by these extremes.
 
     Within the Jovian magnetosphere, the energetic (>=20 keV)
particle populations play an important dual role.  First, they
represent a major factor in determining the size, shape, and dynamics
of the system.  For example, observations of energetic particle
intensities and corresponding energy densities show that these
populations are important in (1) standing off the solar wind and
thereby determining magnetopause position; (2) determining the general
magnetic field configuration in the evening magnetosphere and (3)
establishing the bulk of the ring current responsible for the
magnetodisk configuration of the middle-Jovian magnetosphere.
 
     Secondly the energetic particles play an important diagnostic
role in the determination of energization, transport, and loss
processes active in the Jovian magnetosphere.  In this role they also
provide a remote sensing capability for identifying magnetospheric
structures through finite gyroradius effects and for diagnosing remote
processes through field-aligned flow, E x B drift, and magnetic drift
effects.
 
     The Galileo EPD will provide major extensions to the Jovian
energetic particle data base obtained from the Pioneer and Voyager
flybys.  For example:
(1)  Galileo will be placed into a highly elliptical orbit around
Jupiter.  The nominal two-year mission lifetime will allow both a
direct measure of time variations in the Jovian magnetosphere and a
significantly larger spatial sample of the system than has been
possible with the previous flybys.
(2) The nominal mission includes several close ( < 1000 km) flybys of
the Galilean satellites thereby providing the best opportunity to date
to observe details of the satellite/magnetospheric interactions.
(3)  The EPD provides the first 4-pi steradian angular coverage for
Jovian energetic particles, thereby assuring that the necessary
energetic particle measurements will be obtained independent of
satellite orientation and magnetic field direction.
(4)  The low-energy thresholds of the EPD effectively close the energy
gap between plasma and energetic particle measurements that has
existed in previous observations and assures that processes thought to
operate in that gap will be tested by direct observation.  For
example, it has been suggested that the particles powering Jovian
aurora are ions of energies <=100 keV/nucl, a composition energy range
to be measured by Galileo instrumentation at Jupiter.
 
EPD OVERVIEW
 
     The EPD instrument is the result of a joint effort between The
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), The
Max-Planck-Institute fur Aeronomie (MPAe) and The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration Space Environment Laboratory (NOAA/SEL).
Proposed in 1976 with initial funds received in late 1977, the EPD was
launched onboard the Galileo spacecraft on October 12, 1989.  The MPAe
was responsible for the detector heads and three analog circuit boards
associated with those heads.  The NOAA/SEL was responsible for the
original time-of-flight (TOF) circuitry.  The TOF circuitry employed
in the upgraded TOF detector actually flown (and described in the
composition measurement system, CMS, section) was the joint
responsibility of MPAe and JHU/APL.  The JHU/APL was responsible for
all remaining electronics, the scanning motor, the data system,
instrument power, structure test, instrument integration, and
spacecraft integration.  Calibrations were performed by JHU/APL and
MPAe.
     The general characteristics of the EPD are listed in the
following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
     The two bi-directional solid-state detector telescopes are the
Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS) and the
Composition Measurement System (CMS).  These detector heads are
mounted on a platform and rotated by a stepper motor contained in the
main electronics box.  The combination of the satellite spin and the
stepper motor rotation (nominally stepping to the next position after
each spacecraft spin) provides 4 pi steradian coverage of the unit
sphere.  The 0 degree ends of the two telescopes have a clear field of
view over the unit sphere and also can be positioned behind a
foreground shield/source holder for background measurements and
in-flight calibrations.  The 180 degree ends experience obscuration
effects in motor positions 4, 5, and 6 caused by the magnetometer boom
and foreground shield.
     The zero degree end of the LEMMS unit uses magnetic deflection
to separate electrons from ions and provides, from detectors A and B,
total-ion energy above ~20keV and from detectors E1, E2 and F1, F2
electron spectra above ~15keV.  The 180 degree end of LEMMS uses
absorbers in combination with detectors C and D to provide
measurements of ions >~16Mev and electrons >~2Mev.
     The zero degree end of the CMS telescope employs a
time-of-flight (TOF) versus total energy technique to measure
elemental energy spectra above ~10keV/nucl for helium through iron.  A
sweeping magnet in the entrance collimator prevents electrons with
energies <~256keV from entering the system.  TOF start and stop pulses
are generated as the incoming ions pass, respectively, through a thin
entrance foil and impinge on the detector KT.  Electrons released from
the foil and the detector are accelerated and deflected through a
series of grids and are detected by the microchannel places, MCP1 and
MCP2.  The time difference between the start pulse, MCP1, and the stop
pulse, MCP2, is then obtained, along with the ion total energy from
KT.  Knowing the ion total energy and its travel time through the
system (which gives its velocity), the ion mass is determined.
     The 180 degree end of the CMS telescope measures the ion
energy loss, deltaE, as the ions pass through detectors Ja and Jb and
the ion residual energy E=E(total) - deltaE, as they impact detectors
Ka and Kb.  The resulting deltaE and E measurement provides a measure
of ion composition for energies >~200keV/nucl.
     The planned normal mode of EPD operation is to have both the
telescopes powered and to step the stepper platform once each
satellite spin.  This will yield a 4-pi scan of the unit sphere
approximately every 140s.  Many other scanning modes are available and
will be used for special circumstances.  For example, during satellite
encounters, the EPD will be configured to scan particular directions
such as the expected direction of the magnetic flux tube, the
direction of the Galilean satellite wakes as they travel through the
Jovian magnetosphere, and the direction of the E x B drift paths.

Phase 2 Implications of LGA Mission for EPD:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
     In its normal mode EPD uses 912 bps to transmit 64 rate channels,
with time resolution of 1/3, 2/3, or 4/3 seconds. The S/C spin period
is ~20 seconds and the EPD motor moves to a new polar angle every spin.
Ground processing converts this time based data stream into displays
with 7 polar angles and 64, 32, or 16 azimuthal sectors.  The LRS
record mode will still provide this resolution of coverage.
 
In the LGA mission EPD was allocated bit rates of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or
40 bps, depending on S/C TM format. The lowest bit rates will be the
most common.
 
At these low rates the EPD measurements must be sectored on board the
S/C, and accumulated for extended periods. The challenge was to design
a realizable combination of channels, time and angular resolution that
fits the available bit rate and maximizes science return.
 
 
EPD LGA Science Mission Design:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction
 
The EPD collects particle flux measurements from almost the entire 4-pi
sphere by making and reporting fairly rapid particle measurements as the
spacecraft and the EPD motor platform sweep the EPD sensors through the
sky. The instrument simultaneously samples the particle flux in a number
of energy ranges, and sorts the particles out by mass, energy, and
direction.
 
It is important to preserve the directional information on the particle
measurements, as well as the mass and energy information. While the
temporal variations are also important to the science team, they are of
lower priority. In considering any new telemetry scheme, therefore, it
is necessary to preserve the mass, energy, and direction information.
 
Ideally, the EPD instrument could adapt to the reduced telemetry
allocations by doing on-board data averaging, editing, compression, etc.
Unfortunately, the version 1&2 software telemetry formats are
time-based, and do not easily support theses types of operations without
eliminating the directional information. It will therefore be necessary
to redesign the telemetry format such that it is spin-based; such an
approach allows data from adjacent spins to be averaged together, thus
reducing the bit rate required to send down the results.
 
It was determined that the EPD already contains sufficient hardware and
software resources necessary to handle the new tasks required of it,
however the rate channel RAM buffer storage requirements far exceed what
could be made available in the instrument. This single result drives
most of the interface requirements that will be presented below.
 
A number of cooperative EPD+CDS processing approaches have been looked
at with an eye to keeping as many tasks and storage buffers in the EPD
as possible. To generate a useful EPD data set, it will be necessary to
transfer raw rate channel data to the CDS, where it will be summed into
appropriate sector-based 4-byte counters. These counters will be
log-compressed, formatted, and passed on to the CDS telemetry processor
at the end of each instrument cycle.
 
 
2. Software Versions
 
The EPD instrument software has undergone a number of changes of the
course of the mission development cycle. The original instrument
software was finalized in about 1980, and was committed to ROM
fabricated by Sandia National Labs. This  software version, which I'll
refer to as the 'Version1' software, is still in the flight
instrument.
 
Prior to the original launch date of 1986, a few minor bugs were
discovered in the  software, and several small RAM patches were designed
to correct the problems. These  patches were tested in SAF during the
original integration checkout, but were never flown.
 
After the Challenger disaster, the EPD hardware underwent a number of
major modifications to support the addition of a new CMS TOF sensor.
Included in these modifications was the addition of a high voltage power
supply. New software was needed to operate the high voltage power
supply, reformat the telemetry output, and control enables, etc. The
software also included corrections to the minor bugs in the original
code. This software version, which I'll refer to as the 'Version2'
software, was to be the standard operating code for the 1989 mission. It
is important to note that if the REV2 software patch is not loaded, the
instrument reverts to the Rev1 (ROM- based) software. In this mode, the
instrument performs 99% of its intended functions, with the exception
that the high voltage supply (and thus the CMS TOF) can not be used.
This mode was used at Venus, Gaspra, and Ida.
 
The S-band mission will require us to greatly modify the way the EPD
collects and formats telemetry. New EPD software must be written to
enable the EPD to perform a number of new tasks. This software will work
closely with new software in the CDS which will collect and average the
EPD rate readouts. I will refer to the combined new real-time mode EPD
and CDS software as the 'Version3' version software.
 
There will be periods during the Galileo mission (such as satellite
encounters) when the CDS will collect data at the old, HGA-based rates.
After the data will be put on the tape recorded for later playback, the
system will revert back to the standard S-band collection scheme. A
requirement for the new Version3 software, therefore, is that it be
easily backward-compatible. By this I mean that it should be relatively
painless to quickly switch from the old HGA-based software to the new
Rev3 software.
 
When the instrument is put back into the record mode, we will want the
capability to operate the full instrument, i.e. the CMS TOF and high
voltage supply. It would therefore be desirable to have the ability to
switch from the Version3 software to the previous Version2 software. It
is not clear that we would want or be able to use all of the features
that were included in the Version2 software, however. We will therefore
modify the previous Version2 software for use with the LGA mission. This
version, which I'll refer to as the 'Version4' software, will handle
many of the same tasks as the Version2 software, but may not have all
the 'bells and whistles' in order to make the code more compact.
 
To summarize the material above:
 
EPD Software  Description
Version1      Original ROM-based code
Version2      Code generated for 1989 HGA mission
Version3      New real-time mode telemetry rate code for LGA-based
              mission
Version4      New record mode telemetry rate code for LGA-based mission
 
 
3. Science Background
 
The EPD instrument combines the output of two fairly independent sensor
subsystems, the LEMMS sensor and the CMS sensor. Two types of data are
produced by each of these sensors: rate channel data (channel counters)
and PHA (single event pulse height analysis) data. The science telemetry
is made up of rate channel and PHA data from both sensors.
 
The EPD science team has evaluated the scientific priorities from the
instrument in the context of a telemetry-starved SBAND environment. The
minimum spatial and temporal resolution requirements were determined for
each measurement; measurements with similar requirements were then
grouped together. A strawman telemetry format was then created by
trading off the projected telemetry and memory allocations for the EPD
vs. The science return from the measurements.
 
For the Version3 telemetry format, we decided to report all the CMS TOF
sensor rate channel measurements and selected PHA events. The LEMMS rate
channels measurements were also preserved. None of the CMS Delta-E x E
sensor measurements or LEMMS PHA spectral measurements were kept,
 however, except for LRS periods.
 
3.1 Spatial Resolution
 
The EPD motor was intended to quickly move the EPD sensor view angle
between 8 defined positions. These positions, called motor positions
(sometimes motor sectors) are numbered from 0 to 7, and are nominally 30
degrees apart. The calibrate position, 0 , is the exception, and is 45
 degrees away from position 1.
 
Unit sphere coverage for the EPD's sensors is provided by combining the
EPD motor stepping and the motion of the spacecraft spin. In the
original telemetry design, most rate channels were read and reported via
telemetry at least 15 times in each motor position (20 seconds). These
measurements were repeated in each of the 8 motor positions, yielding
120 spatial measurements per channel across the unit sphere.
 
Unfortunately, this type of spatial resolution will not be possible in
the Version3 software. To create the broader spatial sectors needed to
maintain some directional information on the particle fluxes while
conserving bit-rate, we divided the spacecraft spin into four 90-degree
sectors, and used the motor stepping pattern between positions 0 and 6
(7 will not be used). This reduces the original 120 sectors to only 28
sectors (4 spin sectors x 7 motor positions).
 
To reduce the bit-rate further, these 28 sectors will be summed together
using one of three algorithms. These algorithms will be used to produce
sector patterns which we'll call the 'high,' 'low,' and 'omni'
spatial resolution channel types. The unit sphere will now be divided
into either 17, 7, or 2 'super' sectors; each of these was the result
of summing one or more sectors together.
 
Each of the rate channels will be assigned to use one of these three
channel type formats; the more important the channel's data, the higher
the resolution it is given.
 
3.2 Motor Stepping
 
The EPD motor movement is directed primarily by the motor controller
board, and its associated processor hardware and software. The motor
controller is a slave to the data system board; its commands are
generated by and/or received from the data system, and its status is
sent to the data system.
 
As its name implies, the motor controller board handles all low level
motor control functions. It determines direction, stepping pattern,
position measurement, etc., and generates the actual motor phase pulses
that move the motor. Each time an electrical pulse is sent to the motor,
it will take a 'step' of 1.8 degrees. A series of pulses, sent over
about 1/2 second, is normally used to move the motor from one motor
position to the next.
 
The overall, high-level timing of the motor, however, is dictated by
the data system; it generates motor 'trigger' signals that tell the
motor controller when to initiate a motor movement. In the original
 design, the motor triggers are sent once every 20 seconds, but this
 timing can be altered via the 'motor dwell' command.
 
The motor trigger should be viewed as a timing synchronization signal,
not a command to move. When the motor controller receives the motor
trigger, its processor examines what stepping mode it is presently
executing. If the motor had been commanded to cease scan or stop at a
particular sector, the motor will do nothing in response to the motor
trigger; it will initiate a motor movement only if the commanded
stepping mode requires one.
 
In the new Version3 software, the data system will synchronize the motor
movement to the spacecraft spin by generating a motor trigger at the
 beginning of each spin of the spacecraft. The data system will use the
 CDS-supplied AACS spin vector information to determine when a new spin
has started. The motor controller interface will remain the same in that
it will simply respond to motor triggers using its original software.
 
The motor system operates in a 'windshield wiper' mode; it rotates 235
degrees in one direction, then reverses itself and goes back 235 degrees
in the opposite direction. Within this 235 degree rotational space,
there are 8 predefined, discrete motor positions, numbered 0 through 7.
In the Record Mode, the motor will visit all 8 positions, moving once
every 20 seconds from one position to the next (the actual motor
movement requires approximately 1/2 second).
 
In the Real-time Mode, the motor will only visit 7 of the 8 positions;
position number 7 is not used. The motor stepping will be synchronized
to the spacecraft spin rate, moving once per spin when the spacecraft
spin vector passes through 0. The motor movement synchronization is good
to 1/3 second resolution, resulting in approximately 6 degree
uncertainty. More information on the Real-time motor movements is
included in later sections of this document.
 
3.3 Temporal Resolution
 
As stated before, most EPD channels were previously read out once every
4/3 seconds. In the Version3 telemetry format, the channel read outs
will vary depending on what the EPD telemetry allocation is. The higher
the bit-rate, the higher the time resolution that will be used.
 
A new EPD data construct, called the EPD science record, will be used to
group the science measurements together. A science record will extend
over a number of spacecraft rotations; the sectorized rate channel data
in the record will be averaged across the multiple spins.
 
An EPD science record period will always be an integer multiple of EPD
cycles, where a motor cycle is defined as 6 EPD motor position steps.
Since the EPD motor will be synchronized to move once per spacecraft
spin, a motor cycle is 6 equal to spacecraft spin periods. Assuming a
nominal spin rate of 3.15 rpm, the nominal spin period is 19.048
seconds. Our minimum science record is one motor cycle (114.29 seconds)
and our maximum is 6 motor cycles (685.71 seconds or 11.4 minutes).
 
Worst-case time resolution chosen to be ~12 minutes (at 5 bps). This
should be reasonable--much of the Voyager analysis was done with 15
minute averages. Higher resolution will be available at the higher bit
rates. Angular resolution chosen to cover 4 Pie steradians with 1, 6, or
 16 measurements (and cal).
 
As described above, each rate channel is assigned to use one of the
three channel type formats. If these assignments were frozen, however,
it would not be possible to make good use of the variable bit-rate
allocated to the EPD. For this reason, two different mappings of rate
channel to channel type assignment will be used. These mappings will be
referred to as Channel Map 1 and Channel Map 2. The proposed channel
mappings are shown in Tables below. 3.4 Channel Bins
 
The combination of a rate channel and its channel map will create rate
channel 'bins.' The number of bins assigned to a rate channel can be
determined by looking at the number of readouts made in the unit sphere
for the channel; this is defined by which rate channel type the rate
channel is mapped to. To clarify, I'll give an example:
 
The LEMMS rate channel 'A4' is assigned to the a 'low' channel type
under Channel Map 1, and a 'high' channel type under Channel Map 2.
 Since a 'low' channel type incorporates 7 readouts across the unit
 sphere, there will be 7 bins assigned to A4 when the EPD bit rate
allocation dictates the use of Channel Map 1. Similarly, there will be
17 bins assigned to A4 when the EPD bit rate allocation dictates the use
of Channel Map 2.
 
By totaling up the number of bins assigned to each rate channel in the
two channel maps, we determine that under Channel Map 1, there will be
167 CMS bins and 189 LEMMS bins, for a total of 356 bins. Under Channel
Map 2, there will be a 202 CMS bins and 249 LEMMS bins, for a total of
451 bins.
 
It is important to remember that the counts that go into these bins are
generated by the instrument across many spacecraft spins, and the bins
are written to in a quasi random fashion, based on where the spacecraft
spin vector is pointing and what motor position the EPD is in. This
means that the data contained in these bins must be stored somewhere
throughout the science record, not just when a channel is being read.
 
The EPD rate channel accumulators each contain 24 bits counters, thus a
maximum count of 2^24=16,777,216 can be held in each accumulator before
it will role-over. If the bin is to be read once every science record,
(maximum time of 685.71 seconds long), a 24 bit bin can only handle an
average count rate of only about 24K counts/sec. Some of the LEMMS and
CMS rate channels should produce counts are rates above 200K per second.
For this reason, at least some of the bins must be 4 bytes long to
handle the expected range.

  ===================
    The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), originally developed
    for the Russian-led Mars-96 mission, was selected as part of the
    Orbiter payload for ESA s Mars Express mission. The HRSC is a
    pushbroom scanning instrument with nine CCD line detectors
    mounted in parallel in the focal plane. Its unique feature is the
    ability to obtain near-simultaneous imaging data of a specific
    site at high resolution, with along-track triple stereo, four
    colours and five different phase angles, thus avoiding any time-
    dependent variations of the observational conditions. An
    additional Super-Resolution Channel (SRC) a framing device will
    yield nested images in the metre-resolution range for detailed
    photogeologic studies. The spatial resolution from the nominal
    periapsis altitude of 250 km will be 10 m px 1, with an image
    swath of 53 km, for the HRSC and 2.3 m px 1 for the SRC.
    During the mission s nominal operational lifetime of 1 Martian
    year (2 Earth years) and assuming an average HRSC data transfer
    share of 40%, it will be possible to cover at least 50% of the
    Martian surface at a spatial resolution of d 15 m px 1. More than
    70% of the surface can be observed at a spatial resolution of d
    30 m px 1, while more than 1% will be imaged at better than 2.5 m
    px 1. The HRSC will thus close the gap between the medium- to
    low resolution coverage and the very high-resolution images of
    the Mars Observer Camera on the Mars Global Surveyor mission and
    the in situ observations and measurements by landers. The HRSC
    will make a major contribution to the study of Martian
    geosciences, with special emphasis on the evolution of the
    surface in general, the evolution of volcanism, and the role of
    water throughout Martian history. The instrument will obtain
    images containing morphologic and topographic information at high
    spatial and vertical resolution, allowing the improvement of the
    cartographic base down to scales of 1:50 000. The experiment will
    also address atmospheric phenomena and atmosphere-surface
    interactions, and will provide urgently needed support for
    current and future lander missions as well as for exobiological
    studies. The goals of HRSC on Mars Express will not be met by any
    other planned mission or instrument.

  Instrument Specification
  ========================
    The HRSC instrument consists of the camera unit containing the
    HRSC stereo colour scanner and the Super-Resolution Channel
    (SRC), and of the digital unit. The unique capability of the HRSC
    stereo colour scanner is to obtain quasi-simultaneously high-
    resolution images in three-line stereo, in four colours and at
    five phase angles. The combination with the SRC makes it a five-
    in-one camera:
    - the along-track acquisition of stereo imagery avoids changes
      in atmospheric and illumination conditions which so far have
      caused severe problems in the photogrammetric evaluation of
      stereo images acquired at well-separated times;
    - the triple stereo images permit robust stereo reconstruction,
      yielding Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) at a vertical resolution
      similar to the high pixel resolution of the nadir sensor, with
      10 m px 1 at 250 km altitude (periapsis);
    - the colour images enable terrain classification and provide
      information on compositional variations and surface weathering
      as a complement to the more specific (but with lower spatial
      resolution) mineralogical information obtained by the imaging
      spectrometer of Mars Express;
    - the multiphase imagery will address the physical properties of
      the Martian soil (roughness, grain size, porosity) via
      photogrammetric data evaluation by providing a second stereo
      angle triplet (in essence quintuple stereo);
    - the super-resolution imagery, nested in the broader swath of
      the scanner with a spatial resolution of 2.3 m px 1 at
      periapsis, will serve as the magnifying lens to analyse surface
      morphology at even greater detail.
 
    The HRSC stereo colour scanner is a multi-sensor pushbroom
    instrument, with nine CCD line sensors mounted in parallel
    delivering nine superimposed image swaths. Originally, it was
    developed as the HRSC instrument for the Russian Mars-96 mission.
    Two fully tested and calibrated Flight Models were prepared, and
    only minor modifications to the remaining version were required
    to satisfy the Mars Express interface requirements. The stereo
    colour scanner comprises a baffle, optics, optical bench,
    spectral filters, CCD sensors lines, sensor electronics and
    thermal control system. The technical design is defined by:
    - single-optics design;
    - CCD line arrays with 5272 pixels each;
    - nine detectors for simultaneous stereo and colour imaging,
      and for multi-phase angle measurements;
    - CCDs and sensor electronics implemented in high-reliability
      hybrid, low-noise and low-power technology;
    - implementation of the CCD-control unit in ASICs.
 
    The SRC is a framing device and uses an interline CCD detector to
    cope with the very short exposure and read-out times. It is based
    on an instrument development for the Rosetta Lander and the
    design is characterised by:
    - CCD area array interline detector with 1024 x 1032 pixels;
    - highly miniaturised and low-power detector and control
      electronics;
    - compact 3D multi-chip module technology using thin-film
      multilayer metallisation, dycostrate, plasma-etching and chip-
      on-wire technology;
    - selectable dynamic range of 8- and 14-bit per pixel;
    - internal data buffer to store eight 8-bit (or four 14-bit)
      images;
    - lightweight Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope with a focal length
      of 975 mm
 
 
  INSTRUMENT OPERATION
  ====================
    In general, the HRSC (Camera Head) and the SRC will be operated
    simultaneously. However, the Camera Head and the SRC also can be
    operated separately.
 
    The SRC can be operated
    - in the direct mode (direct input into the DU)
      In the case of joint operations with the Camera Head (CH) this
      mode requires that the 9 CCD line signals are processed by three
      of the four signal chains (which reduces the possible number of
      configurations or macro modes). The fourth signal chain is
      exclusively used for SRC.
      The SRC data is fully integrated in the basic HRSC data stream.
    - in the buffer mode
      This mode is applicable for all HRSC macro modes. Eight 8-bit or
      four 14-bit SRC images can be stored in an internal buffer. At
      the end of an imaging session these images are processed by the
      signal chain #4.
    For each of the SRC operational modes the following exposure modes
    can be selected by command:
    - spot mode: single images
    - raster mode: images taken at a predefined time distance
    - contiguous imaging: raster imaging with such a distance between
      subsequent exposures that a contiguous image strip is generated
 
    The HRSC instrument output rate is mainly defined by the scan
    frequency of the Camera Head, i.e. it changes with the S/C
    altitude. The SRC images are fully embedded in the HRSC instrument
    data stream. They reach not more than 10% in the entire data
    stream even in the contiguous mode. The HRSC data output rate is
    reduced by two measures:
    - pixel binning Each of the four signal chains can be commanded to
      sum pixels in flight and across flight direction: 1x1, 2x2, 4x4
      and 8x8 (macropixel formats). One signal chain can handle only -
      one sensor 1x1 or - up to two sensors 2x2 or - up to four
      sensors 4x4 or - up to eight sensors 8x8 or - SRC images
    - Data compression Each of the four signal chains performs in
      parallel an on-line (hardware) data compression with a modified
      JPEG algorithm. The compression rate is defined not directly but
      only through a quality factor given by command. In general we
      assume compression factors from 6..10 for nominal operations.
      The actual output at a certain time instance rate depends on the
      compression behaviour (scene contents, buffer handling of the
      hardware etc) and cannot be exactly predicted.]]></field>

  Instrument Specification
  ========================
    The HRSC instrument consists of the camera unit containing the
    HRSC stereo colour scanner and the Super-Resolution Channel
    (SRC), and of the digital unit. The unique capability of the HRSC
    stereo colour scanner is to obtain quasi-simultaneously high-
    resolution images in three-line stereo, in four colours and at
    five phase angles. The combination with the SRC makes it a five-
    in-one camera:
    - the along-track acquisition of stereo imagery avoids changes
      in atmospheric and illumination conditions which so far have
      caused severe problems in the photogrammetric evaluation of
      stereo images acquired at well-separated times;
    - the triple stereo images permit robust stereo reconstruction,
      yielding Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) at a vertical resolution
      similar to the high pixel resolution of the nadir sensor, with
      10 m px 1 at 250 km altitude (periapsis);
    - the colour images enable terrain classification and provide
      information on compositional variations and surface weathering
      as a complement to the more specific (but with lower spatial
      resolution) mineralogical information obtained by the imaging
      spectrometer of Mars Express;
    - the multiphase imagery will address the physical properties of
      the Martian soil (roughness, grain size, porosity) via
      photogrammetric data evaluation by providing a second stereo
      angle triplet (in essence quintuple stereo);
    - the super-resolution imagery, nested in the broader swath of
      the scanner with a spatial resolution of 2.3 m px 1 at
      periapsis, will serve as the magnifying lens to analyse surface
      morphology at even greater detail.
 
    The HRSC stereo colour scanner is a multi-sensor pushbroom
    instrument, with nine CCD line sensors mounted in parallel
    delivering nine superimposed image swaths. Originally, it was
    developed as the HRSC instrument for the Russian Mars-96 mission.
    Two fully tested and calibrated Flight Models were prepared, and
    only minor modifications to the remaining version were required
    to satisfy the Mars Express interface requirements. The stereo
    colour scanner comprises a baffle, optics, optical bench,
    spectral filters, CCD sensors lines, sensor electronics and
    thermal control system. The technical design is defined by:
    - single-optics design;
    - CCD line arrays with 5272 pixels each;
    - nine detectors for simultaneous stereo and colour imaging,
      and for multi-phase angle measurements;
    - CCDs and sensor electronics implemented in high-reliability
      hybrid, low-noise and low-power technology;
    - implementation of the CCD-control unit in ASICs.
 
    The SRC is a framing device and uses an interline CCD detector to
    cope with the very short exposure and read-out times. It is based
    on an instrument development for the Rosetta Lander and the
    design is characterised by:
    - CCD area array interline detector with 1024 x 1032 pixels;
    - highly miniaturised and low-power detector and control
      electronics;
    - compact 3D multi-chip module technology using thin-film
      multilayer metallisation, dycostrate, plasma-etching and chip-
      on-wire technology;
    - selectable dynamic range of 8- and 14-bit per pixel;
    - internal data buffer to store eight 8-bit (or four 14-bit)
      images;
    - lightweight Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope with a focal length
      of 975 mm
 
 
  INSTRUMENT OPERATION
  ====================
    In general, the HRSC (Camera Head) and the SRC will be operated
    simultaneously. However, the Camera Head and the SRC also can be
    operated separately.
 
    The SRC can be operated
    - in the direct mode (direct input into the DU)
      In the case of joint operations with the Camera Head (CH) this
      mode requires that the 9 CCD line signals are processed by three
      of the four signal chains (which reduces the possible number of
      configurations or macro modes). The fourth signal chain is
      exclusively used for SRC.
      The SRC data is fully integrated in the basic HRSC data stream.
    - in the buffer mode
      This mode is applicable for all HRSC macro modes. Eight 8-bit or
      four 14-bit SRC images can be stored in an internal buffer. At
      the end of an imaging session these images are processed by the
      signal chain #4.
    For each of the SRC operational modes the following exposure modes
    can be selected by command:
    - spot mode: single images
    - raster mode: images taken at a predefined time distance
    - contiguous imaging: raster imaging with such a distance between
      subsequent exposures that a contiguous image strip is generated
 
    The HRSC instrument output rate is mainly defined by the scan
    frequency of the Camera Head, i.e. it changes with the S/C
    altitude. The SRC images are fully embedded in the HRSC instrument
    data stream. They reach not more than 10% in the entire data
    stream even in the contiguous mode. The HRSC data output rate is
    reduced by two measures:
    - pixel binning Each of the four signal chains can be commanded to
      sum pixels in flight and across flight direction: 1x1, 2x2, 4x4
      and 8x8 (macropixel formats). One signal chain can handle only -
      one sensor 1x1 or - up to two sensors 2x2 or - up to four
      sensors 4x4 or - up to eight sensors 8x8 or - SRC images
    - Data compression Each of the four signal chains performs in
      parallel an on-line (hardware) data compression with a modified
      JPEG algorithm. The compression rate is defined not directly but
      only through a quality factor given by command. In general we
      assume compression factors from 6..10 for nominal operations.
      The actual output at a certain time instance rate depends on the
      compression behaviour (scene contents, buffer handling of the
      hardware etc) and cannot be exactly predicted.]]></field>

  ===================
    The instrument consists of a 0.1 mm thick gold foil of hemispherical
    shape with three grids at the entrance (entrance grid, charge grid,
    and shield), as well as an ion collector and channeltron detector.
    The maximum sensitive area (for particles moving parallel to the
    sensor axis) is 0.1 m**2.  Upon impact the particle produces a
    plasma, whose charge carriers are separated by an electric field
    between the target and the ion collector.  Negative charges (mainly
    electrons) are collected at the target. The positive charges are
    collected partly by the ion collector and partly by a channeltron.
    The channeltron is used as it is insensitive to electric and
    vibrational noise.  See Gruen et al. (1992b) [GRUENETAL1992B] for
    more information concerning the instrument.
 
 
  Science Objectives Summary
  ==========================
    The objective of the Ulysses dust experiment is to investigate the
    physical and dynamical properties of small dust particles (10**-16
    to 10**-6g) as a function of ecliptic latitude and heliocentric
    distance, and the study of their interrelation with
    interplanetary/interstellar phenomena.  The parameters to be
    determined include the mass, speed, flight direction and electric
    charge of individual particles.  Specific objectives are:
 
    - To determine the impact rate, size frequency, and the distribution
      of flight directions and electric charges of interplanetary dust
      particles
    - To classify particle orbits into bound orbits around the Sun or
      hyperbolic orbits leaving or entering the solar system
    - To study the distributions of orbital elements (semi-major axis,
      eccentricity, inclination ) of particles in bound orbits
    - To determine as functions of heliocentric distance and ecliptic
      latitude the spatial density of the interplanetary large particle
      population which generally moves in bound orbits around the sun,
      and to determine the relative significance of comets and asteroids
      as sources for these zodiacal dust particles
    - To measure the flux and velocity of particles coming in hyperbolic
      orbits from the general direction of the Sun
    - To identify interstellar dust particles and perform direct
      measurements of the spatial density, heliocentric distribution,
      velocity and mass of interstellar grains traversing the solar
      system
    - To observe enhancements of cometary dust particles during the
      transit of the spacecraft through the plane of a comet's orbit
    - To investigate the spatial density of dust particles within the
      asteroid belt and determine the amount of dust produced by
      collisions in the asteroid belt
    - To investigate the influence of the Jovian gravitational field on
      the interplanetary dust population
    - To measure electric charges of dust particles and establish the
      relationship of these charges to the properties of the ambient
      plasma (plasma density, energy spectrum), the solar radiation
      spectrum and magnetic fields
 
 
  Instrument Measurements
  =======================
    Positively or negatively charged particles entering the sensor are
    first detected via the charge which they induce in the charge grid
    while flying between the entrance and shield grids.  The grids
    adjacent to the charge pick-up grid are kept at the same potential
    in order to minimize the susceptibility of the charge measurement to
    mechanical noise.  All dust particles - charged or uncharged - are
    detected by the ionization they produce during the impact on the
    hemispherical impact sensor.  After separation by an electric field,
    the ions and electrons of the plasma are accumulated by charge
    sensitive amplifiers (CSA), thus delivering two coincident pulses of
    opposite polarity.  The rise times of the pulses, which are
    independent of the particle mass, decrease with increasing particle
    speed.  From both the pulse heights and rise times, the mass and
    impact speed of the dust particles are derived by using empirical
    correlations between these four quantities.
 
 
  Detector Description
  ====================
    The sensor consists of a grid system for the measurement of the
    particle charge, an electrically grounded target (hemisphere) and a
    negatively biased ion collector.  A charged dust particle entering
    the sensor will induce a charge in the charge grid, which is
    connected to a charge sensitive amplifier.  The output voltage of
    this amplifier rises until the particle passes this grid, and falls
    off to zero when it reaches the shield grid.  The peak value (Q_p)
    is stored for a maximum of 600 microseconds and is only processed if
    an impact is detected by the impact ionization detector within this
    time.  A dust particle hitting the hemispherical target produces
    electrons and ions, which are separated by the electric field
    between hemisphere and ion collector into negative charges
    (electrons and negative ions) and positive ions.  The negative
    charges are collected at the hemisphere and measured by a charge
    sensitive amplifier (Q_e).  Positive ions are collected and measured
    at the negatively biased ion collector with a charge sensitive
    amplifier (Q_i).  Some of the ions penetrate the ion collector
    (which is partly transparent - total transmission approximately 40
    percent), are further accelerated, and hit the entrance cone of an
    electron multiplier (channeltron).  Secondary electrons are
    produced, amplified, and measured by a charge sensitive amplifier
    (Q_c).  Other quantities measured are the rise times of both the
    positive and negative charge pulses.  The measurement of the time
    delay between electron pulse and ion pulse serves as a means for
    distinguishing impact events from noise.  Impact events have time
    delays of 2-50 microseconds, while mechanical noise has a time delay
    of milliseconds.  These signal amplitudes and times of a single
    recorded event are digitized and stored in an Experiment Data Frame
    (EDF).
 
    A measurement cycle is initiated if either the negative charge Q_e
    on the hemispherical target, or the positive charge Q_i on the
    ion-collector, or the positive charge Q-c on the channeltron exceeds
    a threshold. Since the hemisphere has a large area which is directly
    exposed to interplanetary plasma and high-energy radiation, this may
    cause some interference for the Q_e measurement.  To avoid this
    interference during high activity times, it is possible to switch by
    command to a mode in which a measurement cycle is initiated if only
    the charge on the ion collector Q_i (small area and not directly
    exposed) or channeltron signal Q_c exceeds the threshold.  If more
    than one event occurs within the transmission time of one EDF, then
    these events are counted by several amplitude-dependent counters.
    The dead-time caused by the measurement cycles is 5 milliseconds.
 
    The signals from the sensor are conditioned and analysed.  The
    microprocessor coordinates the experiment measurement cycle,
    collects the buffered measurement data and processes the data
    according to a program stored in the memory.
 
 
  Calibration Description
  =======================
    Impact tests with iron, carbon, and silicate particles were
    performed at the Heidelberg dust accelerator facility.  The
    particles were in the speed range from 1 to 70 km/s and in the mass
    range from 1.0E-15 to 1.0E-10 grams.  In addition to the projectile
    material variation, calibrations for iron particles with varying
    impact angles were done.  See Goller and Gruen (1989) for more
    information.
 
    To obtain calibrations without information about the impact angle
    and the composition of an impacting micrometeoroid, a set of curves
    (one for each measurement channel) was calculated, which were
    averaged over three different materials (iron, carbon, and silicate)
    and over the range of relevant impact angles (20 to 53 degrees).
    The measurements were done at different angles with iron particles
    and at one fixed angle (20 degrees) with carbon and silicate
    projectiles.  Difficulties in accelerating glass and carbon
    projectiles and the low acceleration rate made it impossible to do
    tests at more than one angle.
 
    A computer simulation of the detector exposed to an isotropic
    particle flux leads to the result that 50 percent of the particles
    hit the detector under an angle of 32 degrees or lower, relative to
    the sensor axis.  Its effective viewing cone covers a solid angle of
    1.4 sr.  As the target is curved (hemispherical) the impact angle,
    measured relative to the target normal at the point of impact, is
    generally different from the angle of incidence (relative to the
    sensor axis).  The direction of travel of the impacting particle can
    not be determined.  From the computer simulation the most probable
    impact angle is 28 degrees, the average angle is 36 degrees.  This
    information, used with the pointing of the instrument, can be used
    to obtain a rough estimate of the particle trajectory.  The
    particle's flight path inside the detector was determined to be 20
    +/- 5 cm.
 
    There are three possibilities for the determination of a particle's
    speed (the risetimes and the ratio Q_c/Q_i).  Using all three
    measurements and comparing them with the calibration curves, the
    speed can be determined with an accuracy of a factor of 1.6. Using
    only one the accuracy is given by a factor of 2.
 
    With a known particle speed the mass can be determined from the
    charge yields Q_i/m and Q_e/m.  If the speed is known within a
    factor of 1.6 and both yields are used for mass measurements the
    value can be measured with an uncertainty of a factor of 6.  The
    main part of this error is caused by the limited accuracy of the
    speed measurement.  The smallest impact charge Q_i detectable is
    about 10**14 coulomb which corresponds to a mass and speed dependent
    threshold that can be approximated by a power law (see Gruen et al.,
    1995a).
 
 
  Instrument Modes
  ================
    Different instrument modes exist to alter the instrument's
    susceptibility to noise.  These modes are changed by adjusting the
    thresholds of the detectors aboard the instrument.  The thresholds
    are altered by telecommand from Earth.  The threshold levels of the
    detectors are included within the dataset.
 
 
  Onboard Processing
  ==================
    See Gruen et al, 1992b and 1995c [GRUENETAL1992B],
    [GRUENETAL1995C].
 
    First, the instrument microprocessor, which controls the experiment
    measurement cycle, collects the buffered data and processes the data
    according to its onboard program. This takes about 5 ms.  The signal
    amplitudes and times of a single recorded event (dust impact or
    noise) are digitized and stored in an Experiment Data Frame (EDF) of
    16 bytes (i.e. 128 bits). Supplementary information like event time
    and instantaneous spin position are collected from the spacecraft
    and added in each EDF. Dead-time caused by the measurement cycle is
    5 ms.
 
    The instruments are designed to reliably operate under noisy
    conditions thereby allowing the reliable extraction of true dust
    impacts from noise events. True impacts can be detected at rates of
    as low as one per month.  This is achieved by raising the threshold
    levels of all impact signals individually by telecommand which
    allows instrument sensitivity to be adapted to the actual noise
    environment on board the spacecraft.  Coincidences between the
    signals are established which, along with the signal amplitudes, are
    used to classify each event.
 
    Each measured event (noise or impact) is classified according to the
    strength of its ion signal (IA) into one of six amplitude ranges
    (AR=1 to 6). Each amplitude range correspond roughly to one decade
    in electronic charge, Q_I. In addition, each event is categorized
    into one of four event classes (described by the class number CLN).
    The event classification scheme, which defines criteria that must be
    satisfied for each class, is shown:
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Parameters:  |  CLN=0  |  CLN=1  |       CLN=2        |       CLN=3

    CN        |         |         |                    |      CN <= SP10
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    Within each class these conditions are connected by logical 'and'
    except where noted. Class 0 (CLN = 0) includes all events that are
    not categorized in a higher class (typically noise and unusual
    impact events - e.g. impacts onto the sensor's internal structure
    other than the impact target).  In classes 1 through 3, the criteria
    become increasingly restricted so that CLN = 3 generally represents
    true dust impact events only. Some of the set point values (SP01 to
    SP15), which can be set by ground command, are used in the
    classification scheme. The set points are as follows:
 
                        SP01         =  1
                        SP02         = 15
                        SP03         =  1
                        SP04         = 15
                        SP09         =  2
                        SP10         =  8
                        SP11         =  8
                        SP14         =  0
                        SP15         =  0
                        SP16         =  0
 
    The on board classification can be adapted to the in-flight noise
    environment by changing the thresholds and classification parameters
    (set points) or by adjusting the onboard classification program
    through telecommands. Detailed information on noise is mandatory in
    order to evaluate the reliability of impact detection for the
    various event categories, to minimize the effect on dead-time and to
    optimize memory utilization.
 
    The memory is divided into separate ranges in which various data is
    given priority. The A-range of instrument memory stores the six most
    recent EDFs - one for each amplitude range regardless of class. The
    E range, graphically depicted below, stores the last 8 events
    occurring within class 3. These events satisfy the most stringent
    constraints and are almost certainly true impacts.
 
    The above four classes, together with six amplitude ranges,
    constitute twenty-four separate categories. Each of these categories
    has its own 8-bit accumulator:
 
                    |         |    Class number (CLN)
                    |Amplitude|
               IA   |  Range  |  0      1      2      3
             -------------------------------------------
       0- 7 | AR         = 1  | AC01 | AC11 | AC21 | AC31
       8-15 | AR         = 2  | AC02 | AC12 | AC22 | AC32
      16-23 | AR         = 3  | AC03 | AC13 | AC23 | AC33
      24-32 | AR         = 4  | AC04 | AC14 | AC24 | AC34
      48-55 | AR         = 5  | AC05 | AC15 | AC25 | AC35
      56-63 | AR         = 6  | AC06 | AC16 | AC26 | AC36
 
    As long as the respective accumulator does not overflow, each event
    is counted even if the complete information is not received on
    ground.  Generally, the event rate is so low (even in the low
    amplitude and low class ranges) that the true increment can be
    reliably determined. All categories and corresponding accumulators -
    excluding AC01, AC11 and AC02 - contain primarily impact events.
    Even in these latter categories, true impacts can be identified and
    separated from noise events if the complete data set for an event is
    available [BAGUHLETAL1993].
 
    The transmission of seven EDFs constitute an instrument read-out
    cycle (six A-range events and one of the subcommutated class 3
    events as well as all 24 accumulators) which is continuously
    repeated. The Ulysses mission is designed to provide continuous data
    coverage even when data transmission to Earth is only possible
    during one pass of approximately 8 hours per day. Continuous
    coverage is achieved by storing data from the instruments at a low
    rate into an on-board memory which is read out at a high rate
    together with real-time data transmission during a pass.  At a
    spacecraft data transmission rate of 1024 bps, one EDF is sent every
    16 seconds. Lower bit rates down to 128 bps during storage or real
    time transmission periods are possible.
 
 
  Data processing on the ground
  =============================
    After receiving the partially processed data from the spacecraft,
    the following data processing steps are performed on the ground:
 
         (1) instrument health check
         (2) generation of accumulator histories
         (3) extraction of discrete events
         (4) reduction of impact data
         (5) generation of data products
 
    The instrument health check involves inspection of instrument house
    keeping data such as temperatures, voltages, currents and a check of
    the test pulse data. If, for example, the temperature readings are
    too high, the heater power level can be set accordingly.
 
    If excessive noise is detected then appropriate measures, such as
    changing the thresholds or channeltron high voltage by telecommand,
    can be taken.  Occasionally, tests of different instrument modes are
    performed in order to probe the actual noise environment; the
    instrument parameters can then be adjusted accordingly.
 
    The preparation of data products is the final routine step of dust
    data processing. A number of separate files are produced which
    reflect various stages of data processing.
 
 
  Instrument Mounting
  ===================
    The instrument is located on the equipment platform of the
    spacecraft body and its axis is at an angle of 85 degrees with
    respect to the positive z axis,  where the z axis is the rotation
    axis of the spacecraft and the positive direction is where the axis
    points roughly towards Earth.  The Ulysses dust detector weighs 3.8
    kg and consumes 2.2 W.]]></field>

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The instrument consists of a 0.1 mm thick gold foil of hemispherical
    shape with three grids at the entrance (entrance grid, charge grid,
    and shield), as well as an ion collector and channeltron detector.
    The maximum sensitive area (for particles moving parallel to the
    sensor axis) is 0.1 m**2.  Upon impact the particle produces a
    plasma, whose charge carriers are separated by an electric field
    between the target and the ion collector.  Negative charges (mainly
    electrons) are collected at the target. The positive charges are
    collected partly by the ion collector and partly by a channeltron.
    The channeltron is used as it is insensitive to electric and
    vibrational noise.  See Gruen et al. (1992b) [GRUENETAL1992B] for
    more information concerning the instrument.
 
 
  Science Objectives Summary
  ==========================
    The objective of the Ulysses dust experiment is to investigate the
    physical and dynamical properties of small dust particles (10**-16
    to 10**-6g) as a function of ecliptic latitude and heliocentric
    distance, and the study of their interrelation with
    interplanetary/interstellar phenomena.  The parameters to be
    determined include the mass, speed, flight direction and electric
    charge of individual particles.  Specific objectives are:
 
    - To determine the impact rate, size frequency, and the distribution
      of flight directions and electric charges of interplanetary dust
      particles
    - To classify particle orbits into bound orbits around the Sun or
      hyperbolic orbits leaving or entering the solar system
    - To study the distributions of orbital elements (semi-major axis,
      eccentricity, inclination ) of particles in bound orbits
    - To determine as functions of heliocentric distance and ecliptic
      latitude the spatial density of the interplanetary large particle
      population which generally moves in bound orbits around the sun,
      and to determine the relative significance of comets and asteroids
      as sources for these zodiacal dust particles
    - To measure the flux and velocity of particles coming in hyperbolic
      orbits from the general direction of the Sun
    - To identify interstellar dust particles and perform direct
      measurements of the spatial density, heliocentric distribution,
      velocity and mass of interstellar grains traversing the solar
      system
    - To observe enhancements of cometary dust particles during the
      transit of the spacecraft through the plane of a comet's orbit
    - To investigate the spatial density of dust particles within the
      asteroid belt and determine the amount of dust produced by
      collisions in the asteroid belt
    - To investigate the influence of the Jovian gravitational field on
      the interplanetary dust population
    - To measure electric charges of dust particles and establish the
      relationship of these charges to the properties of the ambient
      plasma (plasma density, energy spectrum), the solar radiation
      spectrum and magnetic fields
 
 
  Instrument Measurements
  =======================
    Positively or negatively charged particles entering the sensor are
    first detected via the charge which they induce in the charge grid
    while flying between the entrance and shield grids.  The grids
    adjacent to the charge pick-up grid are kept at the same potential
    in order to minimize the susceptibility of the charge measurement to
    mechanical noise.  All dust particles - charged or uncharged - are
    detected by the ionization they produce during the impact on the
    hemispherical impact sensor.  After separation by an electric field,
    the ions and electrons of the plasma are accumulated by charge
    sensitive amplifiers (CSA), thus delivering two coincident pulses of
    opposite polarity.  The rise times of the pulses, which are
    independent of the particle mass, decrease with increasing particle
    speed.  From both the pulse heights and rise times, the mass and
    impact speed of the dust particles are derived by using empirical
    correlations between these four quantities.
 
 
  Detector Description
  ====================
    The sensor consists of a grid system for the measurement of the
    particle charge, an electrically grounded target (hemisphere) and a
    negatively biased ion collector.  A charged dust particle entering
    the sensor will induce a charge in the charge grid, which is
    connected to a charge sensitive amplifier.  The output voltage of
    this amplifier rises until the particle passes this grid, and falls
    off to zero when it reaches the shield grid.  The peak value (Q_p)
    is stored for a maximum of 600 microseconds and is only processed if
    an impact is detected by the impact ionization detector within this
    time.  A dust particle hitting the hemispherical target produces
    electrons and ions, which are separated by the electric field
    between hemisphere and ion collector into negative charges
    (electrons and negative ions) and positive ions.  The negative
    charges are collected at the hemisphere and measured by a charge
    sensitive amplifier (Q_e).  Positive ions are collected and measured
    at the negatively biased ion collector with a charge sensitive
    amplifier (Q_i).  Some of the ions penetrate the ion collector
    (which is partly transparent - total transmission approximately 40
    percent), are further accelerated, and hit the entrance cone of an
    electron multiplier (channeltron).  Secondary electrons are
    produced, amplified, and measured by a charge sensitive amplifier
    (Q_c).  Other quantities measured are the rise times of both the
    positive and negative charge pulses.  The measurement of the time
    delay between electron pulse and ion pulse serves as a means for
    distinguishing impact events from noise.  Impact events have time
    delays of 2-50 microseconds, while mechanical noise has a time delay
    of milliseconds.  These signal amplitudes and times of a single
    recorded event are digitized and stored in an Experiment Data Frame
    (EDF).
 
    A measurement cycle is initiated if either the negative charge Q_e
    on the hemispherical target, or the positive charge Q_i on the
    ion-collector, or the positive charge Q-c on the channeltron exceeds
    a threshold. Since the hemisphere has a large area which is directly
    exposed to interplanetary plasma and high-energy radiation, this may
    cause some interference for the Q_e measurement.  To avoid this
    interference during high activity times, it is possible to switch by
    command to a mode in which a measurement cycle is initiated if only
    the charge on the ion collector Q_i (small area and not directly
    exposed) or channeltron signal Q_c exceeds the threshold.  If more
    than one event occurs within the transmission time of one EDF, then
    these events are counted by several amplitude-dependent counters.
    The dead-time caused by the measurement cycles is 5 milliseconds.
 
    The signals from the sensor are conditioned and analysed.  The
    microprocessor coordinates the experiment measurement cycle,
    collects the buffered measurement data and processes the data
    according to a program stored in the memory.
 
 
  Calibration Description
  =======================
    Impact tests with iron, carbon, and silicate particles were
    performed at the Heidelberg dust accelerator facility.  The
    particles were in the speed range from 1 to 70 km/s and in the mass
    range from 1.0E-15 to 1.0E-10 grams.  In addition to the projectile
    material variation, calibrations for iron particles with varying
    impact angles were done.  See Goller and Gruen (1989) for more
    information.
 
    To obtain calibrations without information about the impact angle
    and the composition of an impacting micrometeoroid, a set of curves
    (one for each measurement channel) was calculated, which were
    averaged over three different materials (iron, carbon, and silicate)
    and over the range of relevant impact angles (20 to 53 degrees).
    The measurements were done at different angles with iron particles
    and at one fixed angle (20 degrees) with carbon and silicate
    projectiles.  Difficulties in accelerating glass and carbon
    projectiles and the low acceleration rate made it impossible to do
    tests at more than one angle.
 
    A computer simulation of the detector exposed to an isotropic
    particle flux leads to the result that 50 percent of the particles
    hit the detector under an angle of 32 degrees or lower, relative to
    the sensor axis.  Its effective viewing cone covers a solid angle of
    1.4 sr.  As the target is curved (hemispherical) the impact angle,
    measured relative to the target normal at the point of impact, is
    generally different from the angle of incidence (relative to the
    sensor axis).  The direction of travel of the impacting particle can
    not be determined.  From the computer simulation the most probable
    impact angle is 28 degrees, the average angle is 36 degrees.  This
    information, used with the pointing of the instrument, can be used
    to obtain a rough estimate of the particle trajectory.  The
    particle's flight path inside the detector was determined to be 20
    +/- 5 cm.
 
    There are three possibilities for the determination of a particle's
    speed (the risetimes and the ratio Q_c/Q_i).  Using all three
    measurements and comparing them with the calibration curves, the
    speed can be determined with an accuracy of a factor of 1.6. Using
    only one the accuracy is given by a factor of 2.
 
    With a known particle speed the mass can be determined from the
    charge yields Q_i/m and Q_e/m.  If the speed is known within a
    factor of 1.6 and both yields are used for mass measurements the
    value can be measured with an uncertainty of a factor of 6.  The
    main part of this error is caused by the limited accuracy of the
    speed measurement.  The smallest impact charge Q_i detectable is
    about 10**14 coulomb which corresponds to a mass and speed dependent
    threshold that can be approximated by a power law (see Gruen et al.,
    1995a).
 
 
  Instrument Modes
  ================
    Different instrument modes exist to alter the instrument's
    susceptibility to noise.  These modes are changed by adjusting the
    thresholds of the detectors aboard the instrument.  The thresholds
    are altered by telecommand from Earth.  The threshold levels of the
    detectors are included within the dataset.
 
 
  Onboard Processing
  ==================
    See Gruen et al, 1992b and 1995c [GRUENETAL1992B],
    [GRUENETAL1995C].
 
    First, the instrument microprocessor, which controls the experiment
    measurement cycle, collects the buffered data and processes the data
    according to its onboard program. This takes about 5 ms.  The signal
    amplitudes and times of a single recorded event (dust impact or
    noise) are digitized and stored in an Experiment Data Frame (EDF) of
    16 bytes (i.e. 128 bits). Supplementary information like event time
    and instantaneous spin position are collected from the spacecraft
    and added in each EDF. Dead-time caused by the measurement cycle is
    5 ms.
 
    The instruments are designed to reliably operate under noisy
    conditions thereby allowing the reliable extraction of true dust
    impacts from noise events. True impacts can be detected at rates of
    as low as one per month.  This is achieved by raising the threshold
    levels of all impact signals individually by telecommand which
    allows instrument sensitivity to be adapted to the actual noise
    environment on board the spacecraft.  Coincidences between the
    signals are established which, along with the signal amplitudes, are
    used to classify each event.
 
    Each measured event (noise or impact) is classified according to the
    strength of its ion signal (IA) into one of six amplitude ranges
    (AR=1 to 6). Each amplitude range correspond roughly to one decade
    in electronic charge, Q_I. In addition, each event is categorized
    into one of four event classes (described by the class number CLN).
    The event classification scheme, which defines criteria that must be
    satisfied for each class, is shown:
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Parameters:  |  CLN=0  |  CLN=1  |       CLN=2        |       CLN=3
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EN        |         |         |                    |      EN <= SP11
    IN        |         |         |                    |      IN <= SP09
    CN        |         |         |                    |      CN <= SP10
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    Within each class these conditions are connected by logical 'and'
    except where noted. Class 0 (CLN = 0) includes all events that are
    not categorized in a higher class (typically noise and unusual
    impact events - e.g. impacts onto the sensor's internal structure
    other than the impact target).  In classes 1 through 3, the criteria
    become increasingly restricted so that CLN = 3 generally represents
    true dust impact events only. Some of the set point values (SP01 to
    SP15), which can be set by ground command, are used in the
    classification scheme. The set points are as follows:
 
                        SP01         =  1
                        SP02         = 15
                        SP03         =  1
                        SP04         = 15
                        SP09         =  2
                        SP10         =  8
                        SP11         =  8
                        SP14         =  0
                        SP15         =  0
                        SP16         =  0
 
    The on board classification can be adapted to the in-flight noise
    environment by changing the thresholds and classification parameters
    (set points) or by adjusting the onboard classification program
    through telecommands. Detailed information on noise is mandatory in
    order to evaluate the reliability of impact detection for the
    various event categories, to minimize the effect on dead-time and to
    optimize memory utilization.
 
    The memory is divided into separate ranges in which various data is
    given priority. The A-range of instrument memory stores the six most
    recent EDFs - one for each amplitude range regardless of class. The
    E range, graphically depicted below, stores the last 8 events
    occurring within class 3. These events satisfy the most stringent
    constraints and are almost certainly true impacts.
 
    The above four classes, together with six amplitude ranges,
    constitute twenty-four separate categories. Each of these categories
    has its own 8-bit accumulator:
 
                    |         |    Class number (CLN)
                    |Amplitude|
               IA   |  Range  |  0      1      2      3
             -------------------------------------------
       0- 7 | AR         = 1  | AC01 | AC11 | AC21 | AC31
       8-15 | AR         = 2  | AC02 | AC12 | AC22 | AC32
      16-23 | AR         = 3  | AC03 | AC13 | AC23 | AC33
      24-32 | AR         = 4  | AC04 | AC14 | AC24 | AC34
      48-55 | AR         = 5  | AC05 | AC15 | AC25 | AC35
      56-63 | AR         = 6  | AC06 | AC16 | AC26 | AC36
 
    As long as the respective accumulator does not overflow, each event
    is counted even if the complete information is not received on
    ground.  Generally, the event rate is so low (even in the low
    amplitude and low class ranges) that the true increment can be
    reliably determined. All categories and corresponding accumulators -
    excluding AC01, AC11 and AC02 - contain primarily impact events.
    Even in these latter categories, true impacts can be identified and
    separated from noise events if the complete data set for an event is
    available [BAGUHLETAL1993].
 
    The transmission of seven EDFs constitute an instrument read-out
    cycle (six A-range events and one of the subcommutated class 3
    events as well as all 24 accumulators) which is continuously
    repeated. The Ulysses mission is designed to provide continuous data
    coverage even when data transmission to Earth is only possible
    during one pass of approximately 8 hours per day. Continuous
    coverage is achieved by storing data from the instruments at a low
    rate into an on-board memory which is read out at a high rate
    together with real-time data transmission during a pass.  At a
    spacecraft data transmission rate of 1024 bps, one EDF is sent every
    16 seconds. Lower bit rates down to 128 bps during storage or real
    time transmission periods are possible.
 
 
  Data processing on the ground
  =============================
    After receiving the partially processed data from the spacecraft,
    the following data processing steps are performed on the ground:
 
         (1) instrument health check
         (2) generation of accumulator histories
         (3) extraction of discrete events
         (4) reduction of impact data
         (5) generation of data products
 
    The instrument health check involves inspection of instrument house
    keeping data such as temperatures, voltages, currents and a check of
    the test pulse data. If, for example, the temperature readings are
    too high, the heater power level can be set accordingly.
 
    If excessive noise is detected then appropriate measures, such as
    changing the thresholds or channeltron high voltage by telecommand,
    can be taken.  Occasionally, tests of different instrument modes are
    performed in order to probe the actual noise environment; the
    instrument parameters can then be adjusted accordingly.
 
    The preparation of data products is the final routine step of dust
    data processing. A number of separate files are produced which
    reflect various stages of data processing.

    The instrument is located on the equipment platform of the
    spacecraft body and its axis is at an angle of 85 degrees with
    respect to the positive z axis,  where the z axis is the rotation
    axis of the spacecraft and the positive direction is where the axis

  ===================
    (excerpted from [KEPPLERETAL1992A])
 
    The EPAC sensor will measure the fluxes, angular distributions,
    energy spectra, and composition of ions in the energy range
    from 300 keV/nucleon to 25 MeV/nucleon.
 
    The instrument generates 12 different classes of data.  All
    events are categorised by their (dE/dx)-signal into three crude
    classes; their respective numbers are transmitted from three
    event memories.  So besides the 32 event strings we also get
    per EDF the total number of events recorded during that time
    interval.  Less detailed information on energy spectra are
    obtained with higher time resolution from 4 groups of ions.  8
    energy channels are formed for each group.  Bands,
    corresponding to the (dE/dx-E) tracks are stored in a RAM
    look-up table.  All events are sorted accordingly for 4 ion
    groups (He, C-N-O, S-group, F-group).  For telescopes 2 and 3
    these are in addition resolved into 8 spin-sectors.  A full set
    will be transmitted in about 34 min.  If only one species is
    selected, time resolution increases to ~ 8.5 min.
 
    Protons are identified separately in 8 channels (3-bit PHA)
    using the B-detector outputs (500 keV to 1.6 MeV).  All
    channels are resolved into eight sectors.
 
    From the A-detector's output, integral fluxes of ions are
    obtained.  Contributions will come from ions above an energy,
    defined by dead-layer thickness and electronic threshold of
    about 145 keV.  Contribution from electrons scattered through
    large angles may contribute to the lowest channel, but as the
    detector thickness corresponds to the range of ~ 25 keV
    electrons, its electron detection efficiency is certainly << 1.
 
    The 4 A-detector outputs are connected to the PHA through a
    multiplexer (as are the B-detectors).  The thresholds of the
    PHA are adjusted such, that in 'High Gain'-Mode channel 1 to 3
    'protons' (Z >= 1), in channel 4 to 5 '[alpha]-particles' (i.e.
    Z >= 2), in channel 6-8 'oxygen' (i.e.  Z >= 6) is detected.
    In 'Low-Gain', the passbands are shifted one channel up:
    channel 1 and 2 record now Z >= 1, channels 3 to 4 Z >= 2,
    channels 5 to 7 Z >= 6 and channel 8 Z >= 10 particles.  The
    latter corresponds to about 500 keV/nucleon.  This class of
    data is obtained in 16 min.
 
    Much higher time resolution is obtained from rates, which
    correspond to the integral over energy of the proton and the Z
    >= 1 spectra.  Telescopes 2 and 3 are resolved in eight
    sectors.
 
    The solar aspect angle varies in the course of the mission from
    ~ 90 [degrees] after launch to less than 11.5 [degrees] at
    Jupiter.  It will again increase during polar passage.  This
    means, that there will be periods, when telescopes 1 or 2 will
    be fully illuminated by the sun and might affect the Z >= 1
    data, but not coincidence rates.
 
    Two electron channels corresponding to 100 keV <= E <= 0.4 MeV
    and to E >= 0.3 MeV are also formed for each telescope.  These
    channels are defined from proper combination of dicriminator
    thresholds.  Their energy range is, however, not very

    The EPAC sensor will measure the fluxes, angular distributions,
    energy spectra, and composition of ions in the energy range
    from 300 keV/nucleon to 25 MeV/nucleon.
 
    The instrument generates 12 different classes of data.  All
    events are categorised by their (dE/dx)-signal into three crude
    classes; their respective numbers are transmitted from three
    event memories.  So besides the 32 event strings we also get
    per EDF the total number of events recorded during that time
    interval.  Less detailed information on energy spectra are
    obtained with higher time resolution from 4 groups of ions.  8
    energy channels are formed for each group.  Bands,
    corresponding to the (dE/dx-E) tracks are stored in a RAM
    look-up table.  All events are sorted accordingly for 4 ion
    groups (He, C-N-O, S-group, F-group).  For telescopes 2 and 3
    these are in addition resolved into 8 spin-sectors.  A full set
    will be transmitted in about 34 min.  If only one species is
    selected, time resolution increases to ~ 8.5 min.
 
    Protons are identified separately in 8 channels (3-bit PHA)
    using the B-detector outputs (500 keV to 1.6 MeV).  All
    channels are resolved into eight sectors.
 
    From the A-detector's output, integral fluxes of ions are
    obtained.  Contributions will come from ions above an energy,
    defined by dead-layer thickness and electronic threshold of
    about 145 keV.  Contribution from electrons scattered through
    large angles may contribute to the lowest channel, but as the
    detector thickness corresponds to the range of ~ 25 keV
    electrons, its electron detection efficiency is certainly << 1.
 
    The 4 A-detector outputs are connected to the PHA through a
    multiplexer (as are the B-detectors).  The thresholds of the
    PHA are adjusted such, that in 'High Gain'-Mode channel 1 to 3
    'protons' (Z >= 1), in channel 4 to 5 '[alpha]-particles' (i.e.
    Z >= 2), in channel 6-8 'oxygen' (i.e.  Z >= 6) is detected.
    In 'Low-Gain', the passbands are shifted one channel up:
    channel 1 and 2 record now Z >= 1, channels 3 to 4 Z >= 2,
    channels 5 to 7 Z >= 6 and channel 8 Z >= 10 particles.  The
    latter corresponds to about 500 keV/nucleon.  This class of
    data is obtained in 16 min.
 
    Much higher time resolution is obtained from rates, which
    correspond to the integral over energy of the proton and the Z
    >= 1 spectra.  Telescopes 2 and 3 are resolved in eight
    sectors.
 
    The solar aspect angle varies in the course of the mission from
    ~ 90 [degrees] after launch to less than 11.5 [degrees] at
    Jupiter.  It will again increase during polar passage.  This
    means, that there will be periods, when telescopes 1 or 2 will
    be fully illuminated by the sun and might affect the Z >= 1
    data, but not coincidence rates.
 
    Two electron channels corresponding to 100 keV <= E <= 0.4 MeV
    and to E >= 0.3 MeV are also formed for each telescope.  These
    channels are defined from proper combination of dicriminator
    thresholds.  Their energy range is, however, not very
    accurately defined (due to electron scattering).  For heavy
    ions there are also 16 rate channels for each of the 4
    telescopes and each of the 4 species.  They are read out once
    every 8 minutes.
 
    For each telescope the background rates of detector B and C are
    transmitted, each accumulated over 4 minutes.  The equivalent
    geometrical factor is F[B] = 1.60 cm^2 and F[C] = 6.02 cm^2.
    For coincidence rates of all 3 detectors the geometrical factor
    G = 0.08 cm^2 ster applies.]]></field>

      The Photometry and Polarimetry Net (PPN) magnitude data were
      collected by observers working at institutions all over the
      world with a variety of different instruments.  These are
      documented in Sekanina (1991), listed in the PDS reference
      database as 'JPL D-400-450'.  Each individual observation
      file contains as much information as was available about the
      specific observer, observatory and instrument.  Both broadband
      and marrowband magnitudes are included in the photometric
      magnitude data.
 
      Filters
      =======
      Three groups of filters are included in the magnitude data:
      1) IHW standard narrowband filters, 2) standard UBVRI and uvgri
      filters, and 3) non-standard filters.
 
      The IHW narrowband filters have the following parameters:
 
        Filter ID           Center   Bandpass
 
           OH                3085       60

      The broadband filters are drawn from the UBVRI system and the
      uvgri system defined in Thaun and Gunn (1976) and Wade, et al.
      1979).   Of the uvgri filter set, only the g, r, and i filters
      are represented in the data files.  These are identified by the
      names 'GT', 'RT', and 'IT', respectively.
 
      Note that not all the filters identified as being from the
      standard UBVRI system had the same center wavelength or
      bandpass.  Users are advised to note the actual wavelength
      and bandpass reported, rather than relying on filter names

<field name="instrument_description"><![CDATA[Instrument Overview
    ===================
    The spectroscopic archive consists of data obtained by a
    wide variety of observers, instruments, and techniques. The
    range of observation sites spans the globe and includes the
    upper atmosphere and satellites in Earth orbit. The
    spectroscopic observations of Comet Halley were monitored,
    but not coordinated, by the Spectroscopy Center at Arizona
    State University. Various individual observing programs were
    planned and executed in their entirety by the observers who
    contributed data to the archive. Occasionally the
    observations were made by observers who had no expertise in
    cometary spectroscopy. Fortunately, there was such an
    overwhelmingly universal interest in Comet Halley that
    virtually every large aperture telescope equipped with
    spectroscopic instrumentation obtained at least a few
    spectra of the comet. Thus, the spectroscopic archive
    comprises data obtained with a very diverse array of
    state-of-the-art instruments and detectors in the years
    1985-1986 and represents a unique set of observations of
    Comet Halley. These instruments include simple scanners and
    spectrographs to more complicated Fabry-Perot and echelle
    systems.
 
         The spectroscopic data in the Comet Halley archive
    consist of two basic types: one-dimensional and
    two-dimensional spectra. In the case of one- dimensional
    spectra, the data are measurements vs. wavelength of the
    flux from the comet within a solid angle determined by the
    size of the spectroscopic instrument aperture projected at
    the comet. For the two-dimensional spectra, a spatial
    dimension is added covering the length of the slit projected
    at the comet. Thus a two-dimensional spectrum contains flux
    information for a set of points, determined by the slit
    length used. The two-dimensional spectra can be treated as a
    normal image, as far as manipulation and display. The only
    difference from an image is that one dimension is wavelength
    and the other is spatial. The one-dimensional spectra might
    be displayed as a one-dimensional image, but a graphical
    display, plotting flux vs. wavelength is more conventional.
 
         Both the coma and plasma tail spectra are composite
    with an underlying continuous spectrum contributed by the
    solar radiation scattered by the comet dust. Thus when
    analyzing the gaseous component of the spectrum, the dust-
    reflected solar continuum is usually subtracted from the
    composite spectrum. The spectra of Comet Halley presented in
    this archive can be found in various forms, both with and
    without the correction for the solar background continuum.
    The state of each archive spectrum can generally be
    determined by reading its fits header. Some observers have
    submitted spectra of solar system objects or scattered
    twilight to provide a solar spectrum with the same
    instrument used to observe the comet. These spectra have
    been archived with the Halley spectra and can be used to
    subtract the background solar spectrum from the comet
    spectrum. Also included in the IHW archive as appendices are
    two high resolution spectra obtained directly of the Sun,
    which, when convolved with the appropriate instrument
    profile and corrected for the scattered light wavelength
    dependence (1/lambda), can be used to correct the composite
    comet spectra for scattered sunlight.
 
       It was requested that observers submit data to the IHW in
    reduced form (i.e., F(lambda) vs. lambda versus rho). Most
    of the data in the archive are as fully reduced, or as fully
    reduced as possible (in some instances, such as high
    spectral resolution data, flux calibration may not be
    possible). In some sets, the data are raw, essentially as
    observed. Hopefully with the raw data sets, other
    calibration data have been included as well, although this
    is not always the case. When calibration frames are
    available, their type should be clear from the OBJECT
    keyword. The type of data presented can be determined from
    DAT-TYPE. Data and calibration frames should be correlated,
    based on time and date of observation, observer, and
    observatory.

    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
         During the years 1983-88, the Spectroscopy and
    Spectrophotometry Network (SSN) of the International Halley
    Watch (IHW) was responsible for coordinating, collecting,
    and archiving a wide diversity of spectroscopic observations
    of the periodic comets Halley, Giacobini-Zinner, and
    Crommelin. The spectral domain covered the ultraviolet and
    visible regions, from about 1100 A to 10,000 A, with the
    ground-based data representing the bulk of the spectra and
    covering 3000 A to 10,000 A. Spectra of comets obtained in
    the wavelength regions longer than 10,000 A (1 micron) have
    been archived by the Infrared Network.
 
         The spectra of comet Halley taken from Earth have
    spatial resolutions of about 400 km at best. Such spectra
    obtained remotely arise from three distinct sources in the
    coma: (1) sunlight scattered by the coma dust, (2) neutral
    molecular gas fluorescing with the solar radiation, and (3)
    molecular and atomic ions also excited by resonance
    fluorescence. Solar radiation reflected directly from the
    nucleus of the comet contributes negligibly to the spectrum
    observed from Earth, except when a comet is at relatively
    large heliocentric distances (>5 AU). Spectra in the IHW
    archive obtained with the instrument aperture centered on
    the brightest part of the coma are generally dominated by
    the neutral molecular spectrum of the coma. Spectra offset
    projected distances >100,000 km from the brightest coma
    region toward the tail (anti-solar direction) are generally
    dominated by molecular ions which populate the plasma tail
    of the comet.
 
       Estimates were that the majority (70-80%) of the spectra
    would be recorded in digital format. In fact, virtually all
    the spectroscopic data that we received were in digital
    format. A small percentage (less than 3%) of spectra
    originally recorded on photographic plates were scanned with
    digital microphotometers by observers at their institutes
    and were submitted on magnetic tape. At the time the IHW was
    organized, photographic plates were already on their way
    out. Nearly all observatories that had instrumentation to
    record useful slit spectra of comet Halley had some kind of
    digital detector system.]]></field>

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Instrument Overview
    ===================
    The spectroscopic archive consists of data obtained by a
    wide variety of observers, instruments, and techniques. The
    range of observation sites spans the globe and includes the
    upper atmosphere and satellites in Earth orbit. The
    spectroscopic observations of Comet Halley were monitored,
    but not coordinated, by the Spectroscopy Center at Arizona
    State University. Various individual observing programs were
    planned and executed in their entirety by the observers who
    contributed data to the archive. Occasionally the
    observations were made by observers who had no expertise in
    cometary spectroscopy. Fortunately, there was such an
    overwhelmingly universal interest in Comet Halley that
    virtually every large aperture telescope equipped with
    spectroscopic instrumentation obtained at least a few
    spectra of the comet. Thus, the spectroscopic archive
    comprises data obtained with a very diverse array of
    state-of-the-art instruments and detectors in the years
    1985-1986 and represents a unique set of observations of
    Comet Halley. These instruments include simple scanners and
    spectrographs to more complicated Fabry-Perot and echelle
    systems.
 
         The spectroscopic data in the Comet Halley archive
    consist of two basic types: one-dimensional and
    two-dimensional spectra. In the case of one- dimensional
    spectra, the data are measurements vs. wavelength of the
    flux from the comet within a solid angle determined by the
    size of the spectroscopic instrument aperture projected at
    the comet. For the two-dimensional spectra, a spatial
    dimension is added covering the length of the slit projected
    at the comet. Thus a two-dimensional spectrum contains flux
    information for a set of points, determined by the slit
    length used. The two-dimensional spectra can be treated as a
    normal image, as far as manipulation and display. The only
    difference from an image is that one dimension is wavelength
    and the other is spatial. The one-dimensional spectra might
    be displayed as a one-dimensional image, but a graphical
    display, plotting flux vs. wavelength is more conventional.
 
         Both the coma and plasma tail spectra are composite
    with an underlying continuous spectrum contributed by the
    solar radiation scattered by the comet dust. Thus when
    analyzing the gaseous component of the spectrum, the dust-
    reflected solar continuum is usually subtracted from the
    composite spectrum. The spectra of Comet Halley presented in
    this archive can be found in various forms, both with and
    without the correction for the solar background continuum.
    The state of each archive spectrum can generally be
    determined by reading its fits header. Some observers have
    submitted spectra of solar system objects or scattered
    twilight to provide a solar spectrum with the same
    instrument used to observe the comet. These spectra have
    been archived with the Halley spectra and can be used to
    subtract the background solar spectrum from the comet
    spectrum. Also included in the IHW archive as appendices are
    two high resolution spectra obtained directly of the Sun,
    which, when convolved with the appropriate instrument
    profile and corrected for the scattered light wavelength
    dependence (1/lambda), can be used to correct the composite
    comet spectra for scattered sunlight.
 
       It was requested that observers submit data to the IHW in
    reduced form (i.e., F(lambda) vs. lambda versus rho). Most
    of the data in the archive are as fully reduced, or as fully
    reduced as possible (in some instances, such as high
    spectral resolution data, flux calibration may not be
    possible). In some sets, the data are raw, essentially as
    observed. Hopefully with the raw data sets, other
    calibration data have been included as well, although this
    is not always the case. When calibration frames are
    available, their type should be clear from the OBJECT
    keyword. The type of data presented can be determined from
    DAT-TYPE. Data and calibration frames should be correlated,
    based on time and date of observation, observer, and
    observatory.

    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
         During the years 1983-88, the Spectroscopy and
    Spectrophotometry Network (SSN) of the International Halley
    Watch (IHW) was responsible for coordinating, collecting,
    and archiving a wide diversity of spectroscopic observations
    of the periodic comets Halley, Giacobini-Zinner, and
    Crommelin. The spectral domain covered the ultraviolet and
    visible regions, from about 1100 A to 10,000 A, with the
    ground-based data representing the bulk of the spectra and
    covering 3000 A to 10,000 A. Spectra of comets obtained in
    the wavelength regions longer than 10,000 A (1 micron) have
    been archived by the Infrared Network.
 
         The spectra of comet Halley taken from Earth have
    spatial resolutions of about 400 km at best. Such spectra
    obtained remotely arise from three distinct sources in the
    coma: (1) sunlight scattered by the coma dust, (2) neutral
    molecular gas fluorescing with the solar radiation, and (3)
    molecular and atomic ions also excited by resonance
    fluorescence. Solar radiation reflected directly from the
    nucleus of the comet contributes negligibly to the spectrum
    observed from Earth, except when a comet is at relatively
    large heliocentric distances (>5 AU). Spectra in the IHW
    archive obtained with the instrument aperture centered on
    the brightest part of the coma are generally dominated by
    the neutral molecular spectrum of the coma. Spectra offset
    projected distances >100,000 km from the brightest coma
    region toward the tail (anti-solar direction) are generally
    dominated by molecular ions which populate the plasma tail
    of the comet.
 
       Estimates were that the majority (70-80%) of the spectra
    would be recorded in digital format. In fact, virtually all

  Instrument Description
  ======================
    The magnetic field experiment carried out on the Voyager 1
    mission consists of dual low field (LFM) and high field
    magnetometer (HFM) systems.  The dual systems provide greater
    reliability and, in the case of the LFM's, permit the
    separation of the spacecraft magnetic fields from the ambient
    fields.  Additional reliability is achieved through electronics
    redundancy.  The wide dynamic ranges of +/- 0.002 G for the
    LFM's and +/- 20 G for the HFM's, low quantization uncertainty
    (+/- 12.4, 488 nanoTesla respectively), low sensor RMS noise
    level (0.006 nanoTesla), and the use of data compaction schemes
    to optimize the experiment information rate all combine to
    permit the study of a broad spectrum of phenomena during the
    mission.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The investigations of the magnetic fields and magnetospheres of
    the major planetary systems in the outer Solar System and their
    interactions with the solar wind are primary objectives of the
    space exploration program to be conducted during the Voyager 1
    mission.  In addition, the investigation of the interplanetary
    magnetic field phenomena during the flights is of fundamental
    importance both to the understanding of the magnetospheric
    observations and to a number of outstanding questions in basic
    plasma physics and in the general dynamics of the solar wind.
    If the Heliospheric boundary is penetrated, accurate
    measurement of the interstellar magnetic field is also an
    important objective.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    There are no special operational considerations for the
    magnetometer described in [BEHANNONETAL1977].  All magnetometer
    data are calibrated.  Three types of in-flight calibrations are
    performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level
    calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3) boom-
    alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board
    coils and resulting data (especially important when dual
    magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any
    magnetometer).  Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are
    done approximately once every two months (early in the mission
    they were done more frequently).  The magnetometer team
    generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR's)
    of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they
    are provided which is variable this is about three times per
    year for the so-called mini-CRSMR's, which are two axis rolls.
    Full CRSMR's and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred
    within the last few years (full CRSMR's and mini's differ only
    in the number of rolls in each).  The magnetometer team usually
    succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary
    encounter.  Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after
    launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter.  Others
    have been executed, but it has been determined that the inter-
    sensor misalignment is small and constant.

    The following LFM and HFM values are derived from Table 1 in
    [BEHANNONETAL1977].

  =======================
    The 13 meter Astromast booms have proved in extensive
    pre-flight testing to be highly rigid with respect to bending
    motions but soft to torsional or twisting motion.  Deployment
    repeatability test have shown as much as +/- 7 degrees
    uncertainty in the knowledge of the boom twist angle (about the
    boom axis) at the magnetometer sensor positions, compared with
    +/- 0.5 uncertainty in bend angles (rotation about axes
    orthogonal to the boom axis).  In order to minimize sensor
    alignment uncertainties, a method to estimate an angular
    correction matrix was developed that eliminates most of the
    twist uncertainty and some of the bend uncertainty.  A special
    calibration coil has been wound around the periphery of the
    spacecraft's high gain antenna to generate, upon command, a
    known magnetic field at both LFM magnetometer sensors.  The
    difference between measurements taken when the coil is turned
    on and off is the coil field, independent of all external
    fields.  Using a 20 turn coil of 1/2 amp yields nominal field
    intensities 0f 33.4 and 6.1 nanoTesla at the inboard and
    outboard sensors, respectively.  All magnetometer data are
    calibrated.  Three types of in-flight calibrations are
    performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level
    calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3)
    boom-alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board
    coils and resulting data (especially important when dual
    magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any
    magnetometer).  Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are
    done approximately once every two months (early in the mission
    they were done more frequently).  The magnetometer team
    generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR's)
    of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they
    are provided which is variable this is about three times per
    year for the so-called mini-CRSMR's, which are two axis rolls.
    Full CRSMR's and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred
    within the last few years (full CRSMR's and mini's differ only
    in the number of rolls in each).  The magnetometer team usually
    succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary
    encounter.  Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after
    launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter.  Others
    have been executed, but it has been determined that the
    inter-sensor misalignment is small and constant.  For more
    information, consult [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
 
  LFM and HFM Detectors
  =====================
    Detector Type                  : RING CORE
    Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000
    Nominal Operating Temperature  : 273.000000
 
    Total Fovs                     : 1
    Data Rate                      : UNK
    Sample Bits                    : 12
 
    The magnetometer consists of 6 ring core detectors.  These are
    designated as low field magnetometers (LFM) 1-3 and high field
    magnetometers (HFM) 1-3.  The basic sampling rate is .06 +/-
    .006 seconds.  Sampling rate for the high field system is .6
    seconds.  The detectors measure in the interval of +/- 2.0E+6
    nT for HFM, and +/- 5.0E+4 for LFM.  Nominal operating
    temperature for all detectors is 273 K, though the sensors were
    tested over a range of +/- 60 degrees about the nominal
    temperature.
 
    Both high and low field magnetometer sensors utilize a ring
    core geometry and thus have lower drive power requirements and
    better zero level stability than other types of fluxgates and
    are smaller in size [ACUNA1974].  The cores consist of an
    advanced molybdenum alloy, especially developed in cooperation
    with the Naval Surface Weapons Center, White Oak, Maryland,
    which exhibits extremely low noise and high stability
    characteristics.  The use of this alloy and the ring core
    sensor geometry thus allows the realization of compact, low
    power, ultrastable fluxgate sensors with a noise performance
    that is improved almost an order of magnitude over the best
    previously flown fluxgate sensors.  The HFM's use specially
    processed miniature ring cores (1 cm diameter) which minimize
    the power required to measure large fields.  This description
    is taken directly from [BEHANNONETAL1977].
 
 
    Vector Components
    -----------------
      The LFM1 detector and the HFM1 detector are designated as the
      detectors which measure the i component of the vector
      (i,j,k).  The LFM2 detector and the HFM2 detector are
      designated as the detectors which measure the j component of
      the vector (i,j,k).  The LFM3 detector and the HFM3 detector
      are designated as the detectors which measure the k component
      of the vector (i,j,k).

  Electronics
  ===========
    The instrument is composed of two completely redundant systems:
    the 'P' or primary system and the 'S' or secondary system.
 
    The experiment electronics instrumentation consists of the
    flux-gate magnetometer electronics and associated controls, and
    the calibration and data processing electronics.  Complete
    redundancy is provided for the analog to digital converters,
    data and status readout buffers, command decoders and power
    converters.  Thus not only can the two magnetometers of a
    system be interchanged, but considerable cross-strapping within
    the electronics permits interchange of critical internal
    functions as well.  This significantly reduces the impact of
    single-component failure on the ability of the experiment to
    continue successful operation during the mission duration of >
    4 years.  This description is directly transposed from

    In the CRUISE mode, only the LFM subsystem is operating.  The
    basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3 vectors/second.
 
    In the ENCOUNTER mode, both LFM and HFM subsystems are
    operating.  The basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3
    vectors/second for the LFM system and 5/3 vectors/second for
    the HFM system.

  Instrument Description
  ======================
    The magnetic field experiment carried out on the Voyager 1
    mission consists of dual low field (LFM) and high field
    magnetometer (HFM) systems.  The dual systems provide greater
    reliability and, in the case of the LFM's, permit the
    separation of the spacecraft magnetic fields from the ambient
    fields.  Additional reliability is achieved through electronics
    redundancy.  The wide dynamic ranges of +/- 0.002 G for the
    LFM's and +/- 20 G for the HFM's, low quantization uncertainty
    (+/- 12.4, 488 nanoTesla respectively), low sensor RMS noise
    level (0.006 nanoTesla), and the use of data compaction schemes
    to optimize the experiment information rate all combine to
    permit the study of a broad spectrum of phenomena during the
    mission.
 
 
  Science Objectives
  ==================
    The investigations of the magnetic fields and magnetospheres of
    the major planetary systems in the outer Solar System and their
    interactions with the solar wind are primary objectives of the
    space exploration program to be conducted during the Voyager 1
    mission.  In addition, the investigation of the interplanetary
    magnetic field phenomena during the flights is of fundamental
    importance both to the understanding of the magnetospheric
    observations and to a number of outstanding questions in basic
    plasma physics and in the general dynamics of the solar wind.
    If the Heliospheric boundary is penetrated, accurate
    measurement of the interstellar magnetic field is also an
    important objective.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    There are no special operational considerations for the
    magnetometer described in [BEHANNONETAL1977].  All magnetometer
    data are calibrated.  Three types of in-flight calibrations are
    performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level
    calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3) boom-
    alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board
    coils and resulting data (especially important when dual
    magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any
    magnetometer).  Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are
    done approximately once every two months (early in the mission
    they were done more frequently).  The magnetometer team
    generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR's)
    of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they
    are provided which is variable this is about three times per
    year for the so-called mini-CRSMR's, which are two axis rolls.
    Full CRSMR's and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred
    within the last few years (full CRSMR's and mini's differ only
    in the number of rolls in each).  The magnetometer team usually
    succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary
    encounter.  Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after
    launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter.  Others
    have been executed, but it has been determined that the inter-
    sensor misalignment is small and constant.

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Galileo Ultraviolet Spectrometer investigation will use data
      obtained by two instruments.  The Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)
      covers the wavelength range from 113 to 432 nm and was the original
      instrument selected for the Galileo Orbiter.  The Extreme
      Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) was added to the Orbiter payload
      after the Challenger accident in 1986.  The UVS instrument is
      described in this document;  the EUV instrument will be discussed in
      a separate document.
 
      The UVS instrument consists of a Cassegrain telescope and an
      Ebert-Fastie scanning spectrometer.  Spectral scanning is
      accomplished using a fully programmable diffraction grating drive.
      Three separate photomultiplier detectors, located in the exit focal
      plane of the spectrometer, are used to cover the entire
      ultraviolet-near-visible spectrum from 113 to 432 nm.  Spectral
      scanning, instrument command and control, data formatting, and
      spacecraft interface are all normally controlled by a microprocessor
      within the instrument.  A hardware-controlled logic circuit, called
      Cold Start Mode, controls scanning at power on in the event normal
      commanding capability is inadvertently lost.  The UVS instrument
      components are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in subsequent
      sections of this document.

    Instrument Optics
    =================
      The optical design for the UVS telescope is a Dall-Kirkham
      configuration (elliptical primary mirror and spherical secondary
      mirror) with an effective focal length of 250 mm and a focal ratio
      of f/5.  In order to measure accurate limb profiles, the telescope
      has been equipped with an external sunshade and an extensive baffle
      system for rejection of off-axis scattered light.  The field of view
      is wavelength-dependent, being limited by the spectrometer entrance
      slit to 1 degree by 0.1 degree for two of the detectors (G channel -
      113 to 192 nm and N channel - 282 to 432 nm) and by one of the
      spectrometer exit slits to 0.4 degree by 0.1 degree for the third
      detector (F channel - 162 to 323 nm).  A bright object sensor (limb
      sensor) with a 1.5 degree full width half maximum (FWHM) field of
      view located below the telescope sunshade structure is used to
      protect the long wavelength detector during atmospheric limb
      observations.
 
 
    Spectrometer
    ============
      The spectrometer is a standard, 125 mm focal length, Ebert-Fastie
      design which uses a single spherical mirror as both collimator and
      camera and a plane diffraction grating.  A ruling density of 2400
      grooves per mm provides a first-order dispersion of 23.9 nm per mm
      and an average spectral resolution of 200 for a 0.43-mm-wide
      entrance slit (0.1 degree telescope field of view).
 
      Spectral scanning is accomplished by rotating a diffraction
      grating.  The UVS grating drive uses a moire fringe pattern,
      generated by overlaying two radially etched transmission gratings,
      to control the angular position of the grating.  One of the
      transmission gratings is fixed, and the other rotates with the
      diffraction grating housing.  The transmission gratings have a
      ruling of 1500 lines per 360 degree rotation resulting in a single
      cycle of 0.024 degree and a single phase increment step size of
      0.00375 degree.  Each grating step for the UVS is a sum of six phase
      increment steps or 0.0225 degree.  Thus a grating step results in a
      0.1-mm displacement of the spectrum in the spectrometer focal plane
      so that the spectrum is sampled on the average of 4 times per
      spectral resolution element.
 
      Three photomultiplier tubes, located behind three separate exit
      slits in the focal plane of the spectrometer record the spectrum in
      three overlapping wavelength ranges:  the far-ultraviolet detector
      (G channel) covers the wavelength range 113 to 192 nm,  the
      middle-ultraviolet detector (F channel) covers the wavelength range
      162 to 323 nm, and the near-ultraviolet-visible detector (N
      channel) covers the wavelength range 160 to 450 nm.  Each detector
      has its own high voltage power supply and pulse counting
      electronics, allowing for independent operation.  All three
      detectors are mounted in a single mechanical housing along with
      their high voltage power supplies and
      pulse-amplifier-discriminators.  The G and N photomultipliers are
      located directly behind their respective exit slits in the
      spectrometer housing.  Volume constraints require that the F
      photomultiplier be mounted above the slit plane and light is
      directed to it by a small two mirror periscope located behind the F
      channel exit slit.
 
 
    Instrument Detectors
    ====================
      Three EMR Photoelectric Corp. 510 photomultiplier tubes, located
      behind three separate exit slits in the focal plane of the
      spectrometer record the spectrum in three overlapping wavelength
      ranges.  Each detector has its own high voltage power supply and
      pulse counting electronics, allowing for independent operation.
      Photocathodes and windows for the detectors were chosen to optimize
      measurements in narrow spectral ranges.  The far-ultraviolet
      detector (G channel) is equipped with a magnesium fluoride window
      and a cesium iodide photocathode resulting in a solar blind detector
      with high sensitivity in the wavelength range 113 to 192 nm.  The
      middle-ultraviolet detector (F channel) is equipped with a quartz
      window to block radiation below 160 nm and a cesium telluride
      photocathode to suppress its response to radiation from wavelengths
      longer than 350 nm.  The near-ultraviolet-visible detector (N
      channel) is equipped with a quartz window and a bi-alkali
      photocathode and is sensitive to radiation in the wavelength range
      160 to 450 nm.  The Voyager instruments experienced high radiation
      noise, so additional aluminum shielding was added to the UVS
      instrument.
 
 
    Instrument Microprocessor and Electronics
    ======================================
      The UVS uses an RCA 1802 CMOS microprocessor for command parsing,
      spacecraft time recognition and synchronization, and instrument
      control.  In addition, the UVS design incorporates additional
      electronics called the Cold Start Logic (CSL) that places it into a
      cyclical F-G scan mode until microprocessor control is initiated by
      spacecraft command.  The instrument receives commands and spacecraft
      timing information via the Bus Adaptor and associated Direct Memory
      Access (DMA) logic.  The Bus Adaptor serves as the bi-directional
      interface between the Galileo spacecraft and the UVS.  Its circuitry
      serves to isolate the UVS electrically from the spacecraft and to
      allow for 8-bit information flow to and from the UVS.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The scientific objectives of the Galileo Ultraviolet Spectrometer
      (UVS) investigation include the following:
 
      (1)  THE INTERPLANETARY MEDIUM: By carrying out a systematic program
      of H and He measurements over the course of the mission, UVS will
      improve our knowledge of the interstellar wind (ISW) and of the
      processes that affect its passage through the solar system.
 
      (2)  VENUS:  The geometry of the Galileo flyby permits pole-to-pole
      and dawn-to-dusk measurements by the UVS of the abundance of SO2 in
      the cloud-top region, and of the abundance of H, O, C, and CO in the
      thermosphere.
 
      (3)  EARTH AND MOON:  The post-encounter passage near the subsolar
      point at long range allows the near-simultaneous measurement of
      pole-to-pole and dawn-to-dusk variations in the UV airglow and in
      reflected sunlight, allowing investigation of the global O/N2 ratio
      and the distribution of ozone.  It is also of interest to establish
      the Earth's UV albedo in the Schumann-Runge band region near and
      below 200 nm.  A search for a tenuous lunar atmosphere using the
      resonance emissions of H, O, and OH will address the question of the
      rate of bombardment of the Moon by small bodies, and of the fate of
      solar wind protons that strike the surface.  The flybys also allow
      the Earth-Moon system to be mapped, and these data contain an image
      from each encounter of the hydrogen geocorona from a unique sunward
      vantage point.
 
      (4)  ASTEROIDS:  The UVS measured the albedo of the asteroids Gaspra
      and Ida during flyby.  Spatial resolution on the asteroid surfaces
      was not possible, but their scattering properties as a function of
      phase angle were measured, and the presence of absorption features
      at wavelengths longer than 200 nm was determined.  At these and
      shorter wavelengths the asteroid's albedo may be directly compared
      to that of the Moon measured during the two Earth encounters.  The
      data returned from Gaspra and Ida were limited to a few spectra.
 
      (5)  JOVIAN CLOUDS AND HAZES:  The Galileo orbiting mission offers
      the opportunity to observe Jupiter's clouds and hazes repeatedly
      over a wide range of phase angle and wavelength.  Since its ability
      to examine small scattering angles is restricted by solar protection
      considerations, the contribution of UVS will be to determine the
      imaginary parts of the aerosols' refractive indices by obtaining the
      single-scattering albedo from photometric measurements.  It will
      sample the lower end of the aerosol size distribution due to its
      sensitivity down to 200 nm.  The distribution of aerosols with
      altitude will be measured in the stratosphere by measuring limb
      radiance profiles and in the troposphere by making nadir-to-limb
      scans.  Temporal variability in the properties of clouds and hazes
      will be investigated at time scales ranging from days to the
      duration of the mission.
 
      (6)  COMPOSITION AND CHEMISTRY OF THE JOVIAN STRATOSPHERE:  UVS will
      use reflectance spectroscopy during disc and limb scans to compile
      and inventory numerous hydrocarbons (such as methane, acetylene, and
      ethane) as a function of location and altitude.  UVS limb scans will
      yield stratospheric temperatures through the scale height of the
      signal from Rayleigh-scattered sunlight.
 
      (7)  JOVIAN THERMOSPHERE:  The thermosphere of Jupiter is
      characterized by unexpectedly high temperatures (of order 1100 K in
      the upper thermosphere) and by unexpectedly bright UV emissions from
      molecular hydrogen.  Lyman-alpha  emission from H shows an
      equatorial bulge that sometimes extends across the morning
      terminator.  None of these phenomena have been totally explained.  A
      careful study of spectral, horizontal, vertical, and diurnal and
      other time variations is an important objective for the Galileo UVS
      and EUV experiments, with the goal of gaining insight into these
      phenomena.
 
      (8)  JOVIAN AURORA:  Galileo's mostly equatorial orbits mean that
      the aurora will be observed near the northern or southern limbs,
      allowing excellent longitudinal resolution at the cost of lesser
      latitude resolution.  The spectral effects of atmospheric absorption
      will be enhanced.  Jupiter's rapid rotation will facilitate the
      determination of longitudinal dependencies of the emissions on each
      orbit.  The possibility of correlations between the aurora and
      conditions in the Io torus will be explored.  Galileo will also
      allow comparison of day-side and night-side auroral emissions.
 
      (9)  JOVIAN SATELLITES:  While close-range observations of Io by the
      UVS will be prevented by the radiation environment, Europa and the
      outer two Galilean satellites will be visited a few times in close
      encounters.  The Galileo UVS will measure and map the UV albedos of
      areas of these moons.  The measurements will be compared with those
      of the Moon and of the asteroids Gaspra and Ida.  The rich variety
      of surface terrain and materials will greatly expand our knowledge
      of the UV scattering properties of satellite surfaces.  The UVS will
      also look for evidence of tenuous and possibly sporadic atmospheres
      that might be produced by sublimation, sputtering by co-rotating
      plasma, or even eruptive events.
 
      (10) IO TORUS:  In conjunction with the EUV instrument, the UVS will
      measure the abundance and distribution of the neutral and ionized
      species existing in the Io torus.  Midnight/noon comparisons of the
      torus plasma will be possible.  The surface and atmospheric
      composition of Io and the nature and efficiency of escape and
      ionization processes, as well as the complex interaction of the
      ionized material with the magnetic and gravitational fields of
      Jupiter and with the rest of the magnetosphere, will be
      investigated.  The data are expected to reveal many dynamical
      aspects of the torus in addition to its composition.
 
      (11)  JOVIAN MAGNETOSPHERE:  There are many processes in the
      exosphere of Jupiter, on the constantly irradiated satellites, in
      the Io torus, and in the magnetosphere in general, that might
      provide sources of neutral atoms in the magnetosphere, including H
      and even OH in addition to oxygen and sulfur.  The UVS will search
      for such material at times when the radiation noise in the
      instrument is at a minimum.
 
      (12)  JOINT INVESTIGATIONS:  Collaborative studies are planned with
      the fields and particles investigators, with the goal to improve our
      understanding of the transportation of sulfur and oxygen ions from
      the Io plasma torus to their ultimate precipitation in the Jupiter
      auroral region.  Joint investigations with the Photopolarimeter
      Radiometer (PPR) experiment will help define the particulate
      properties of the Jupiter atmosphere, providing constraints on cloud
      particle size, shape, and composition.  Complementary UVS and PPR
      observations will also provide information about the spatial extent
      and altitude distributions of these clouds.  Properties of the
      satellite surfaces will be measured in cooperation with the Near
      Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), the Solid State Imaging (SSI)
      instrument, and the PPR.  Scattering properties as well as
      ultraviolet absorbers, e.g., sulfur dioxide, will be measured to add
      leverage to our understanding of the Galilean satellites.
 
      (13) SHOEMAKER-LEVY 9:  The UVS obtained a unique 292 nm data set
      during the impact of the SL-9 fragment G, showing a brief 'flash'
      characterized by a brightness temperature near 8000K.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The UVS instrument has operated nominally since launch.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The Galileo UVS flight instrument  (Unit 0001) and engineering test
      instrument (Unit 0000) were calibrated on the ground before launch.
      Several documents and data files exist.  Inflight calibrations were
      also obtained.  The Principal Investigator requests that, until the
      end of the Galileo mission (EOM), any data users who wish
      calibration information beyond that provided in the literature
      should contact the UVS team.  Calibration documents include these
      references:

      [HORDETAL1992] lists the types of calibrations done before launch.
      These include: instrument absolute sensitivity, telescope off-axis
      light rejection, spectrometer scattered light, instrument
      polarization, and spectral line shape and wavelength scale.
      Spacecraft interface measurements were also performed;  these
      included the limb sensor sensitivity and field of view and the
      alignment of the UVS optic axis.  Other calibrations included
      component calibration, such as the detector spatial response and
      sensitivity.
 
      The several inflight calibrations include cross-calibration
      activities between the UVS and EUV instruments during the
      Lyman-alpha All Sky mapping, Earth 1 and Earth 2 X-Cal observations,
      and several boresight observations of the platform teams during the
      cruise, Earth 1 and Earth 2 periods involving several stars.  Two
      UVS star calibrations are currently planned during the Orbital
      period.  Target stars have included: Alpha CMa, Eta UMa, Alpha Eri,
      Alpha Ori, and Alpha Leo.  The Earth's Moon was also used as a
      significant calibration observation during Earth 2.
 
 
    Instrument Modes
    ================
      The Galileo UVS has two operating modes: Cold Start and
      Microprocessor-controlled.  Microprocessor modes are different
      between pre-Jupiter, called Phase 1, operations and post-Jupiter
      operations, called Phase 2.  Generally there are also cruise and
      encounter modes discussed as well within the Phase 1 and Phase 2
      categories.  The instrument delivers 1008 bps to the Command and
      Data System (CDS) Bus in all modes.
 
      Cold Start is actually an automatic, or fail-safe, mode whereby
      hardware circuits control the instrument's grating, or scanning,
      operation.  Two full-wavelength spectral scans are performed using
      the F-channel detector in its standard wavelength range (162 to 323
      nm) and the G-channel detector over its standard wavelength range
      (113 to 192 nm).  One RIM of time, the standard Galileo 'frame',
      consists of fourteen spectra taken over 60.666 seconds.  Note two
      factors: 1) the grating moves in the up (ascending wavelength)
      direction during the first scan of a RIM and moves in the down
      (descending wavelength) direction for the second spectrum; 2) 84
      zeroes, representing one minor frame of 0.666 seconds, are produced
      by the instrument at the BEGINNING of each RIM.
 
      Microprocessor mode describes any time that the UVS microprocessor
      program is controlling the high voltage and/or grating operation of
      the instrument.  Originally designed for both recorded and real-time
      transmission operations, the microprocessor program was modified,
      slightly, for Phase 2 operations:  the major change for phase 2
      includes the use of a CDS buffer to sum pairs of spectra for various
      durations and then to dump the contents of the buffer to the
      real-time telemetry stream, with occasional backup to tape.
 
      PHASE 1
      -------
      The original Phase 1 microprocessor program, Version 5.1, allowed
      for full scan modes with one or two detectors being used during a
      scan pair, and for mini-scan modes where up to four selectable
      wavelength ranges from one detector could be scanned up and down
      during the 4.333 second scan period.  Two wavelength ranges were the
      maximum ever used in this mini-scan operation mode, however.  As
      noted above, the grating moves up and then down, even in mini-scan
      mode.  If two detectors were used in mini-scan mode then the
      detectors were changed only at RIM boundaries.
 
      During Venus, Earth 1 and Earth 2 the UVS made full rate real-time
      and recorded observations of these bodies.  They were generally full
      wavelength scanning observations.  Two mini-scan exceptions were the
      Venus observations and the Hydrogen line all-sky maps.
 
      PHASE 2
      -------
      Microprocessor Version 6.1 is used for all post-Jupiter UVS
      observations.  The two main distinctions of the Phase 2 UVS program
      from the Phase 1 are:  a)  whether the data are being recorded or
      are being summed (over time) by the CDS, and b) the movement of the
      grating drive when in mini-scan mode is different between V5.1 and
      V6.1 flight software.  In Phase 2 a Real Time Science (RTS) CDS
      routine was added to sum pairs of UVS spectra into a CDS internal
      buffer, called the Summation Buffer, in order to reduce the bits to
      ground.  There are three summation periods which are dependent on
      the downlink telemetry format.  The three periods are 29 RIMS, 59
      RIMS, and 1 RIM less than 24 hours.  In each case, one RIM is used
      to transfer and clear the buffer.  This RTS data format allows torus
      data to be obtained during the tape (cruise) playback periods.  In
      record mode the full UVS 1008 bps resolution is maintained on the
      tape.
 
      The order in which mini-scan wavelengths were sampled changed
      between Phase 1 and Phase 2.  In Phase 1 mini-scan mode, each
      mini-scan mode was performed for one spectrum and if a second, third
      or fourth different position was commanded then the next mode was
      performed in the next spectrum.  The next spectrum would contain the
      third and the next spectrum the fourth.  This 1-2-3-4 pattern would
      then repeat with the down wavelength pattern of 4-3-2-1.  A two
      position mini-scan would repeat 1-2-2-1.  In Phase 2, pairs of
      spectra always repeat in the up wavelength pattern.  The two
      position mini-scan becomes 1-2-1-2.  There are no third and fourth
      wavelengths in Phase 2.  This enables the CDS to sum consecutive
      pairs of UVS spectra in the Summation Buffer.  Phase 2 operations
      allow the second mini-scan to be executed with a different
      detector.
 
      In all cases, the detector and wavelength motion and direction are
      sensed within the UVS housekeeping data in the instrument 'fiducial'
      at the start of each spectrum.  The last byte of the microprocessor
      program contains the software version number (times 10).]]></field>

    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Galileo Ultraviolet Spectrometer investigation will use data
      obtained by two instruments.  The Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)
      covers the wavelength range from 113 to 432 nm and was the original
      instrument selected for the Galileo Orbiter.  The Extreme
      Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) was added to the Orbiter payload
      after the Challenger accident in 1986.  The UVS instrument is
      described in this document;  the EUV instrument will be discussed in
      a separate document.
 
      The UVS instrument consists of a Cassegrain telescope and an
      Ebert-Fastie scanning spectrometer.  Spectral scanning is
      accomplished using a fully programmable diffraction grating drive.
      Three separate photomultiplier detectors, located in the exit focal
      plane of the spectrometer, are used to cover the entire
      ultraviolet-near-visible spectrum from 113 to 432 nm.  Spectral
      scanning, instrument command and control, data formatting, and
      spacecraft interface are all normally controlled by a microprocessor
      within the instrument.  A hardware-controlled logic circuit, called
      Cold Start Mode, controls scanning at power on in the event normal
      commanding capability is inadvertently lost.  The UVS instrument
      components are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in subsequent
      sections of this document.

    Instrument Optics
    =================
      The optical design for the UVS telescope is a Dall-Kirkham
      configuration (elliptical primary mirror and spherical secondary
      mirror) with an effective focal length of 250 mm and a focal ratio
      of f/5.  In order to measure accurate limb profiles, the telescope
      has been equipped with an external sunshade and an extensive baffle
      system for rejection of off-axis scattered light.  The field of view
      is wavelength-dependent, being limited by the spectrometer entrance
      slit to 1 degree by 0.1 degree for two of the detectors (G channel -
      113 to 192 nm and N channel - 282 to 432 nm) and by one of the
      spectrometer exit slits to 0.4 degree by 0.1 degree for the third
      detector (F channel - 162 to 323 nm).  A bright object sensor (limb
      sensor) with a 1.5 degree full width half maximum (FWHM) field of
      view located below the telescope sunshade structure is used to
      protect the long wavelength detector during atmospheric limb
      observations.
 
 
    Spectrometer
    ============
      The spectrometer is a standard, 125 mm focal length, Ebert-Fastie
      design which uses a single spherical mirror as both collimator and
      camera and a plane diffraction grating.  A ruling density of 2400
      grooves per mm provides a first-order dispersion of 23.9 nm per mm
      and an average spectral resolution of 200 for a 0.43-mm-wide
      entrance slit (0.1 degree telescope field of view).
 
      Spectral scanning is accomplished by rotating a diffraction
      grating.  The UVS grating drive uses a moire fringe pattern,
      generated by overlaying two radially etched transmission gratings,
      to control the angular position of the grating.  One of the
      transmission gratings is fixed, and the other rotates with the
      diffraction grating housing.  The transmission gratings have a
      ruling of 1500 lines per 360 degree rotation resulting in a single
      cycle of 0.024 degree and a single phase increment step size of
      0.00375 degree.  Each grating step for the UVS is a sum of six phase
      increment steps or 0.0225 degree.  Thus a grating step results in a
      0.1-mm displacement of the spectrum in the spectrometer focal plane
      so that the spectrum is sampled on the average of 4 times per
      spectral resolution element.
 
      Three photomultiplier tubes, located behind three separate exit
      slits in the focal plane of the spectrometer record the spectrum in
      three overlapping wavelength ranges:  the far-ultraviolet detector
      (G channel) covers the wavelength range 113 to 192 nm,  the
      middle-ultraviolet detector (F channel) covers the wavelength range
      162 to 323 nm, and the near-ultraviolet-visible detector (N
      channel) covers the wavelength range 160 to 450 nm.  Each detector
      has its own high voltage power supply and pulse counting
      electronics, allowing for independent operation.  All three
      detectors are mounted in a single mechanical housing along with
      their high voltage power supplies and
      pulse-amplifier-discriminators.  The G and N photomultipliers are
      located directly behind their respective exit slits in the
      spectrometer housing.  Volume constraints require that the F
      photomultiplier be mounted above the slit plane and light is
      directed to it by a small two mirror periscope located behind the F
      channel exit slit.
 
 
    Instrument Detectors
    ====================
      Three EMR Photoelectric Corp. 510 photomultiplier tubes, located
      behind three separate exit slits in the focal plane of the
      spectrometer record the spectrum in three overlapping wavelength
      ranges.  Each detector has its own high voltage power supply and
      pulse counting electronics, allowing for independent operation.
      Photocathodes and windows for the detectors were chosen to optimize
      measurements in narrow spectral ranges.  The far-ultraviolet
      detector (G channel) is equipped with a magnesium fluoride window
      and a cesium iodide photocathode resulting in a solar blind detector
      with high sensitivity in the wavelength range 113 to 192 nm.  The
      middle-ultraviolet detector (F channel) is equipped with a quartz
      window to block radiation below 160 nm and a cesium telluride
      photocathode to suppress its response to radiation from wavelengths
      longer than 350 nm.  The near-ultraviolet-visible detector (N
      channel) is equipped with a quartz window and a bi-alkali
      photocathode and is sensitive to radiation in the wavelength range
      160 to 450 nm.  The Voyager instruments experienced high radiation
      noise, so additional aluminum shielding was added to the UVS
      instrument.
 
 
    Instrument Microprocessor and Electronics
    ======================================
      The UVS uses an RCA 1802 CMOS microprocessor for command parsing,
      spacecraft time recognition and synchronization, and instrument
      control.  In addition, the UVS design incorporates additional
      electronics called the Cold Start Logic (CSL) that places it into a
      cyclical F-G scan mode until microprocessor control is initiated by
      spacecraft command.  The instrument receives commands and spacecraft
      timing information via the Bus Adaptor and associated Direct Memory
      Access (DMA) logic.  The Bus Adaptor serves as the bi-directional
      interface between the Galileo spacecraft and the UVS.  Its circuitry
      serves to isolate the UVS electrically from the spacecraft and to
      allow for 8-bit information flow to and from the UVS.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The scientific objectives of the Galileo Ultraviolet Spectrometer
      (UVS) investigation include the following:
 
      (1)  THE INTERPLANETARY MEDIUM: By carrying out a systematic program
      of H and He measurements over the course of the mission, UVS will
      improve our knowledge of the interstellar wind (ISW) and of the
      processes that affect its passage through the solar system.
 
      (2)  VENUS:  The geometry of the Galileo flyby permits pole-to-pole
      and dawn-to-dusk measurements by the UVS of the abundance of SO2 in
      the cloud-top region, and of the abundance of H, O, C, and CO in the
      thermosphere.
 
      (3)  EARTH AND MOON:  The post-encounter passage near the subsolar
      point at long range allows the near-simultaneous measurement of
      pole-to-pole and dawn-to-dusk variations in the UV airglow and in
      reflected sunlight, allowing investigation of the global O/N2 ratio
      and the distribution of ozone.  It is also of interest to establish
      the Earth's UV albedo in the Schumann-Runge band region near and
      below 200 nm.  A search for a tenuous lunar atmosphere using the
      resonance emissions of H, O, and OH will address the question of the
      rate of bombardment of the Moon by small bodies, and of the fate of
      solar wind protons that strike the surface.  The flybys also allow
      the Earth-Moon system to be mapped, and these data contain an image
      from each encounter of the hydrogen geocorona from a unique sunward
      vantage point.
 
      (4)  ASTEROIDS:  The UVS measured the albedo of the asteroids Gaspra
      and Ida during flyby.  Spatial resolution on the asteroid surfaces
      was not possible, but their scattering properties as a function of
      phase angle were measured, and the presence of absorption features
      at wavelengths longer than 200 nm was determined.  At these and
      shorter wavelengths the asteroid's albedo may be directly compared
      to that of the Moon measured during the two Earth encounters.  The
      data returned from Gaspra and Ida were limited to a few spectra.
 
      (5)  JOVIAN CLOUDS AND HAZES:  The Galileo orbiting mission offers
      the opportunity to observe Jupiter's clouds and hazes repeatedly
      over a wide range of phase angle and wavelength.  Since its ability
      to examine small scattering angles is restricted by solar protection
      considerations, the contribution of UVS will be to determine the
      imaginary parts of the aerosols' refractive indices by obtaining the
      single-scattering albedo from photometric measurements.  It will
      sample the lower end of the aerosol size distribution due to its
      sensitivity down to 200 nm.  The distribution of aerosols with
      altitude will be measured in the stratosphere by measuring limb
      radiance profiles and in the troposphere by making nadir-to-limb
      scans.  Temporal variability in the properties of clouds and hazes
      will be investigated at time scales ranging from days to the
      duration of the mission.
 
      (6)  COMPOSITION AND CHEMISTRY OF THE JOVIAN STRATOSPHERE:  UVS will
      use reflectance spectroscopy during disc and limb scans to compile
      and inventory numerous hydrocarbons (such as methane, acetylene, and
      ethane) as a function of location and altitude.  UVS limb scans will
      yield stratospheric temperatures through the scale height of the
      signal from Rayleigh-scattered sunlight.
 
      (7)  JOVIAN THERMOSPHERE:  The thermosphere of Jupiter is
      characterized by unexpectedly high temperatures (of order 1100 K in
      the upper thermosphere) and by unexpectedly bright UV emissions from
      molecular hydrogen.  Lyman-alpha  emission from H shows an
      equatorial bulge that sometimes extends across the morning
      terminator.  None of these phenomena have been totally explained.  A
      careful study of spectral, horizontal, vertical, and diurnal and
      other time variations is an important objective for the Galileo UVS
      and EUV experiments, with the goal of gaining insight into these
      phenomena.
 
      (8)  JOVIAN AURORA:  Galileo's mostly equatorial orbits mean that
      the aurora will be observed near the northern or southern limbs,
      allowing excellent longitudinal resolution at the cost of lesser
      latitude resolution.  The spectral effects of atmospheric absorption
      will be enhanced.  Jupiter's rapid rotation will facilitate the
      determination of longitudinal dependencies of the emissions on each
      orbit.  The possibility of correlations between the aurora and
      conditions in the Io torus will be explored.  Galileo will also
      allow comparison of day-side and night-side auroral emissions.
 
      (9)  JOVIAN SATELLITES:  While close-range observations of Io by the
      UVS will be prevented by the radiation environment, Europa and the
      outer two Galilean satellites will be visited a few times in close
      encounters.  The Galileo UVS will measure and map the UV albedos of
      areas of these moons.  The measurements will be compared with those
      of the Moon and of the asteroids Gaspra and Ida.  The rich variety
      of surface terrain and materials will greatly expand our knowledge
      of the UV scattering properties of satellite surfaces.  The UVS will
      also look for evidence of tenuous and possibly sporadic atmospheres
      that might be produced by sublimation, sputtering by co-rotating
      plasma, or even eruptive events.
 
      (10) IO TORUS:  In conjunction with the EUV instrument, the UVS will
      measure the abundance and distribution of the neutral and ionized
      species existing in the Io torus.  Midnight/noon comparisons of the
      torus plasma will be possible.  The surface and atmospheric
      composition of Io and the nature and efficiency of escape and
      ionization processes, as well as the complex interaction of the
      ionized material with the magnetic and gravitational fields of
      Jupiter and with the rest of the magnetosphere, will be
      investigated.  The data are expected to reveal many dynamical
      aspects of the torus in addition to its composition.
 
      (11)  JOVIAN MAGNETOSPHERE:  There are many processes in the
      exosphere of Jupiter, on the constantly irradiated satellites, in
      the Io torus, and in the magnetosphere in general, that might
      provide sources of neutral atoms in the magnetosphere, including H
      and even OH in addition to oxygen and sulfur.  The UVS will search
      for such material at times when the radiation noise in the
      instrument is at a minimum.
 
      (12)  JOINT INVESTIGATIONS:  Collaborative studies are planned with
      the fields and particles investigators, with the goal to improve our
      understanding of the transportation of sulfur and oxygen ions from
      the Io plasma torus to their ultimate precipitation in the Jupiter
      auroral region.  Joint investigations with the Photopolarimeter
      Radiometer (PPR) experiment will help define the particulate
      properties of the Jupiter atmosphere, providing constraints on cloud
      particle size, shape, and composition.  Complementary UVS and PPR
      observations will also provide information about the spatial extent
      and altitude distributions of these clouds.  Properties of the
      satellite surfaces will be measured in cooperation with the Near
      Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), the Solid State Imaging (SSI)
      instrument, and the PPR.  Scattering properties as well as
      ultraviolet absorbers, e.g., sulfur dioxide, will be measured to add
      leverage to our understanding of the Galilean satellites.
 
      (13) SHOEMAKER-LEVY 9:  The UVS obtained a unique 292 nm data set
      during the impact of the SL-9 fragment G, showing a brief 'flash'
      characterized by a brightness temperature near 8000K.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The UVS instrument has operated nominally since launch.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The Galileo UVS flight instrument  (Unit 0001) and engineering test
      instrument (Unit 0000) were calibrated on the ground before launch.
      Several documents and data files exist.  Inflight calibrations were
      also obtained.  The Principal Investigator requests that, until the
      end of the Galileo mission (EOM), any data users who wish
      calibration information beyond that provided in the literature
      should contact the UVS team.  Calibration documents include these
      references:

            4-2034, Rev A.

             1993, Internal UVS Team document.
 
      [HORDETAL1992] lists the types of calibrations done before launch.
      These include: instrument absolute sensitivity, telescope off-axis
      light rejection, spectrometer scattered light, instrument
      polarization, and spectral line shape and wavelength scale.
      Spacecraft interface measurements were also performed;  these
      included the limb sensor sensitivity and field of view and the
      alignment of the UVS optic axis.  Other calibrations included
      component calibration, such as the detector spatial response and
      sensitivity.
 
      The several inflight calibrations include cross-calibration
      activities between the UVS and EUV instruments during the
      Lyman-alpha All Sky mapping, Earth 1 and Earth 2 X-Cal observations,
      and several boresight observations of the platform teams during the
      cruise, Earth 1 and Earth 2 periods involving several stars.  Two
      UVS star calibrations are currently planned during the Orbital
      period.  Target stars have included: Alpha CMa, Eta UMa, Alpha Eri,
      Alpha Ori, and Alpha Leo.  The Earth's Moon was also used as a
      significant calibration observation during Earth 2.
 
 
    Instrument Modes
    ================
      The Galileo UVS has two operating modes: Cold Start and
      Microprocessor-controlled.  Microprocessor modes are different
      between pre-Jupiter, called Phase 1, operations and post-Jupiter
      operations, called Phase 2.  Generally there are also cruise and
      encounter modes discussed as well within the Phase 1 and Phase 2
      categories.  The instrument delivers 1008 bps to the Command and
      Data System (CDS) Bus in all modes.
 
      Cold Start is actually an automatic, or fail-safe, mode whereby
      hardware circuits control the instrument's grating, or scanning,
      operation.  Two full-wavelength spectral scans are performed using
      the F-channel detector in its standard wavelength range (162 to 323
      nm) and the G-channel detector over its standard wavelength range
      (113 to 192 nm).  One RIM of time, the standard Galileo 'frame',
      consists of fourteen spectra taken over 60.666 seconds.  Note two
      factors: 1) the grating moves in the up (ascending wavelength)
      direction during the first scan of a RIM and moves in the down
      (descending wavelength) direction for the second spectrum; 2) 84
      zeroes, representing one minor frame of 0.666 seconds, are produced
      by the instrument at the BEGINNING of each RIM.
 
      Microprocessor mode describes any time that the UVS microprocessor
      program is controlling the high voltage and/or grating operation of
      the instrument.  Originally designed for both recorded and real-time
      transmission operations, the microprocessor program was modified,
      slightly, for Phase 2 operations:  the major change for phase 2
      includes the use of a CDS buffer to sum pairs of spectra for various
      durations and then to dump the contents of the buffer to the
      real-time telemetry stream, with occasional backup to tape.
 
      PHASE 1
      -------
      The original Phase 1 microprocessor program, Version 5.1, allowed
      for full scan modes with one or two detectors being used during a
      scan pair, and for mini-scan modes where up to four selectable
      wavelength ranges from one detector could be scanned up and down
      during the 4.333 second scan period.  Two wavelength ranges were the
      maximum ever used in this mini-scan operation mode, however.  As
      noted above, the grating moves up and then down, even in mini-scan
      mode.  If two detectors were used in mini-scan mode then the
      detectors were changed only at RIM boundaries.
 
      During Venus, Earth 1 and Earth 2 the UVS made full rate real-time
      and recorded observations of these bodies.  They were generally full
      wavelength scanning observations.  Two mini-scan exceptions were the
      Venus observations and the Hydrogen line all-sky maps.
 
      PHASE 2
      -------
      Microprocessor Version 6.1 is used for all post-Jupiter UVS
      observations.  The two main distinctions of the Phase 2 UVS program
      from the Phase 1 are:  a)  whether the data are being recorded or
      are being summed (over time) by the CDS, and b) the movement of the
      grating drive when in mini-scan mode is different between V5.1 and
      V6.1 flight software.  In Phase 2 a Real Time Science (RTS) CDS
      routine was added to sum pairs of UVS spectra into a CDS internal
      buffer, called the Summation Buffer, in order to reduce the bits to
      ground.  There are three summation periods which are dependent on
      the downlink telemetry format.  The three periods are 29 RIMS, 59
      RIMS, and 1 RIM less than 24 hours.  In each case, one RIM is used
      to transfer and clear the buffer.  This RTS data format allows torus
      data to be obtained during the tape (cruise) playback periods.  In
      record mode the full UVS 1008 bps resolution is maintained on the
      tape.
 
      The order in which mini-scan wavelengths were sampled changed
      between Phase 1 and Phase 2.  In Phase 1 mini-scan mode, each
      mini-scan mode was performed for one spectrum and if a second, third
      or fourth different position was commanded then the next mode was
      performed in the next spectrum.  The next spectrum would contain the
      third and the next spectrum the fourth.  This 1-2-3-4 pattern would
      then repeat with the down wavelength pattern of 4-3-2-1.  A two
      position mini-scan would repeat 1-2-2-1.  In Phase 2, pairs of
      spectra always repeat in the up wavelength pattern.  The two
      position mini-scan becomes 1-2-1-2.  There are no third and fourth
      wavelengths in Phase 2.  This enables the CDS to sum consecutive
      pairs of UVS spectra in the Summation Buffer.  Phase 2 operations
      allow the second mini-scan to be executed with a different
      detector.
 
      In all cases, the detector and wavelength motion and direction are
      sensed within the UVS housekeeping data in the instrument 'fiducial'
      at the start of each spectrum.  The last byte of the microprocessor
      program contains the software version number (times 10).]]></field>

  Introduction
  ------------
    The Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) represents NASA's third attempt to
    observe Martian weather and monitor the planet's climate using
    modern infrared remote sensing techniques, including limb sounding.
 
    The campaign began in 1986 with the Pressure Modulator Infrared
    Radiometer (PMIRR) [MCCLEESEETAL1986; MCCLEESEETAL1992] on the Mars
    Observer mission, which was lost in 1993 during the final
    pressurization of the spacecraft propulsion system only a few days
    prior to Mars orbit insertion (MOI). NASA re-selected that
    scientific investigation, including an enlarged science team and
    using the same PMIRR instrument design, for another mission, the
    Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO). Launched in 1998, the MCO spacecraft
    entered the Martian atmosphere during MOI and was destroyed. NASA
    selected the same team once more to build the new MCS instrument
    now onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). MCS is not a
    copy of the PMIRR instrument launched in 1992, as the 1998 PMIRR II
    was, but is a smaller, lighter instrument with the same scientific
    objectives as those of the previous two investigations.
 
    The Mars Climate Sounder is the first custom designed infrared
    sounder for systematic meteorological measurements at Mars, using
    the limb viewing technique to obtain relatively high vertical
    resolution of better than one pressure scale height.
 
    The application of modern technology and the use of new high
    performance, linear array thermopile detectors with focal plane
    signal processing and miniature multilayer interference and mesh
    filters has permitted a fivefold reduction in mass, in part by the
    elimination of the requirement for cryogenic operation of the focal
    plane.
 
    The compact dimensions of the design allow the entire instrument to
    be pointed to limb or nadir, for atmospheric and surface mapping
    respectively, and special patterns to be implemented, for example
    for mapping over the poles where the complex physics of the energy
    balance and atmospheric response during the long winter night is to
    be addressed.
 
 
  Mars Climate Sounder Investigation
  ----------------------------------
    MCS is an investigation designed to acquire the high vertical
    resolution, horizontally contiguous measurements needed to take the
    next major step forward in understanding the Martian atmosphere.
 
    MCS will measure thermal emission from the limb of the atmosphere
    in nine spectral bands to obtain profiles with a vertical
    resolution of 5 km (approximately one half the atmospheric scale-
    height on Mars). The MCS investigation will invert accurately
    calibrated measurements of radiance in profiles extending from the
    surface to an altitude of 80 km to obtain vertical profiles of
    atmospheric temperature, water vapor abundance, and dust and
    condensate opacities. MCS will also acquire nadir and off-nadir
    observations that provide additional constraints on atmospheric
    profiles, and measurements of infrared thermal emission and
    broadband solar reflectance of the surface. In the polar regions,
    more frequent nadir and off-nadir measurements will be used to
    characterize the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere,
    which provides constraints on the rates of condensation and
    sublimation of CO2 on the surface and in the atmosphere.  Table 1
    is a high-level description of the instrument observation modes
    and the objectives that they address.

  Investigation Description
  -------------------------
   In 1999, following the failure of the MCO spacecraft,
   a major redesign of the instrument was undertaken by the
   science team. The result is a much-reduced instrument mass,
   a smaller footprint on the payload deck, fewer mechanisms,
   and lower power requirements. PMIRR was a 44-kg instrument
   consuming 40 W. MCS weighs 9 kg and consumes
   11 W of continuous power.
 
   The availability of new high performance, linear array thermopile
   detectors with focal plane signal processing [FOOTEETAL2003] was
   the key that made possible a much-simplified design for MCS without
   compromising performance.
 
 
  Measurement Approach
  --------------------
    MCS employs a nearly continuous limb viewing strategy in order to
    achieve greatly increased sensitivity to minor and trace
    constituents, the atmospheric limb path length being approximately
    50 times that of a nadir view on Mars. The vertical resolution is
    also improved compared with the vertical resolution achievable by
    nadir viewing instruments. Martian targets of interest to the MCS
    investigation are typically low radiance, such as the cold
    low emittance atmosphere and low temperature surfaces (<150 K in
    the polar night). This is another factor that led to the
    selection of a radiometer design that favors large energy grasp
    over spectral resolution. MCS measurements are made in nine
    spectral intervals with 20 cm-1 and broader spectral passbands in
    the range 0.3 - 45 um; see Table 2.

  Instrument Specifications
  =========================
 
    Overview
    --------
      The instrument consists of an optical bench assembly (OBA),
      containing the optics bench, telescopes, and analog and digital
      electronics boards, suspended from a yoke via the elevation
      actuator. The yoke supports the instrument, accommodates instrument
      calibration targets and power conditioning and drive electronics,
      and provides the mechanical and electrical interface with the
      spacecraft via a twist-capsule mounted on the azimuth actuator. A
      similar twist capsule, mounted on the elevation actuator assembly,
      conveys power and signals between the yoke and OBA electronics.
      Table 3 summarizes the primary physical and operational parameters
      of the instrument.

      The entire MCS optical bench is articulated in two axes in order
      that the limb as well as the nadir can be observed. The range of
      articulation is 270 degrees in both azimuth and elevation axes
      providing views of the full hemisphere beneath the nadir-pointed
      payload platform.
 
      Each telescope consists of mirrors and a focal plane assembly
      supported by a metering structure, which is suspended within the
      instrument optical bench. The two identical MCS telescopes are
      differentiated primarily by their focal planes. Telescope A has a
      focal plane with six spectral channels, labeled A1 through A6 in
      Table 2. These visible and mid-IR channels are defined spectrally
      by optical interference filters mounted over six, 21-element linear
      thermopile detector arrays. The telescope B focal plane has three
      far-infrared spectral channels, defined spectrally by conductive
      mesh filters mounted over three detector arrays.
 
      Each MCS focal plane assembly consists of a detector chip, focal
      plane signal processing chips, and a bandpass filter assembly, all
      mounted on a focal plane block.
 
 
    Instrument Optical Design / Telescopes
    --------------------------------------
      The telescopes are of identical design. Both are off-axis, all-
      reflective, telecentric with 4 cm apertures, FOVs of 4.3 degrees,
      and comprising three mirrors. The telescopes are mounted with
      parallel optical axes; rotated 180 degrees relative to each other
      about their prime axes. The instrument aperture is
      defined by the perimeter of the secondary mirror and the tertiary
      mirror focuses an f/1.7 beam through band-pass filters and baffles
      on to the focal plane detectors. The baffles, mounted close to the
      back surfaces of the filters, act as light pipes for the detectors
      and define the FOV response of the individual detector elements.
      Limb-sounding atmospheric measurements with the resolution required
      by MCS place fairly modest requirements on image quality but are
      strongly influenced by the far wings of the FOV response in the
      vertical direction. Focal plane baffles reduce FOV response wings
      produced by scattering within the filters and by thermal radiation
      re-emitted from the detectors. Also, the secondary mirror is
      apodized at the edges, using deposited gold black, to reduce FOV
      wings caused by diffraction at the longer wavelengths.
 
      The telescope mirrors are diamond turned from nickel-plated
      aluminum and post-polished to reduce scattering at visible
      wavelengths. The reflective surface is a silicon dioxide-protected
      aluminum coating, chosen for its reflectivity at both visible and
      infrared wavelengths and its robustness. The aluminum metering
      structure supports the mirrors and its internal surfaces form
      baffles that shield the space between the tertiary mirror and the
      focal plane. An external baffle, mounted on the optical bench,
      prevents stray light reaching the focal plane after only one
      reflection. All the exposed internal surfaces of the metering
      structure and external baffle are treated with Martin Black to
      reduce scattering. Alignment tolerances for the MCS telescope
      permit a 'snap together' design, although provisions are made for
      shimming the primary mirror and focal plane. In practice, only the
      focal plane is adjusted to achieve best focus.
 
      Because MCS is an unchopped radiometer, considerable care is taken
      to minimize thermal drifts in the telescope and focal plane
      assembly. The primary source of variable radiant energy that will
      tend to destabilize the instrument temperature is exposure, once
      per orbit, to the large day-night contrast in solar illumination
      and Martian surface temperature. High thermal stability is achieved
      in MCS by maximizing the thermal mass of the telescope, maximizing
      the thermal conductivity between its component parts, and
      conductively isolating the telescopes from the surrounding optical
      bench, which sees most of the variable environmental heat load from
      the instrument thermal blankets and external baffles. The MCS
      telescopes are each mounted at three points to the optical bench
      via struts with flextures. Conductive isolation between the struts
      and optical bench is provided by fiberglass (G10) washers.
      Temperature control is applied to the optical bench, which acts as
      a stable radiative 'oven' for the telescopes and focal planes.
      The stable thermal environment, all aluminum mirrors and metering
      structure, and flextured interfaces with the optical bench and
      focal plane assembly also minimize thermal distortion in telescope
      alignment.
 
 
    Focal Plane Filters
    -------------------
      The spectral passbands of MCS are defined using individual spectral
      filters mounted in metal frames in front of each of the 9 detector
      arrays. For telescope A, the five mid-infrared filters in the focal
      plane cover the 11.8- to 22.2-um wavelength range (channels A1
      through A5). These are multilayer interference filters manufactured
      by the University of Reading, UK. Germanium was the substrate
      material of choice for the five mid-infrared filters (A1 through
      A5) because of its robust mechanical properties and high optical
      transmission over the full spectral range. The germanium absorption
      band near 20 um was not a major concern because the substrates are
      very thin. The multilayer filters are of conventional design but
      they are unusually small and five filters must fit directly over
      the MCS focal plane. Small filters are cut from a larger substrate.
      Good yield was achieved with this approach with little chipping or
      other damage to the substrates or coatings. The broadband 0.3 to 3
      um filter, A6, is made of UV22 glass, chosen for its blocking from
      3 to 5 um.
 
      The three far infrared filters in focal plane B consist of stacks
      of mesh filters developed by Cardiff University. The same group
      successfully produced air spaced mesh filters for the PMIRR
      instruments. Cardiff produced a 'hot pressed' version of their
      filters consisting of copper meshes on polypropylene substrates,
      which can be cut to fit the smaller MCS filter frames.
 
      Thermal stability of all the spectral filters is critical. The MCS
      thermopile arrays respond to radiation at all wavelengths where
      their surfaces absorb, i.e., where gold black has low reflectivity.
      Small excursions in the temperature of the filters will produce
      measurable signals, because the filters themselves are sources of
      blackbody radiation at all wavelengths away from their narrow
      spectral windows. Temperature changes in the filters due to the
      changing scene, e.g., Mars and the limb of the atmosphere, are
      potentially large enough to cause a measurable, but spurious,
      effect. Note that the filters fill nearly the whole 2pi FOV of the
      detector. A change in the temperature of 5 mK produces a spurious
      signal equivalent to a 1% true signal change in channel A3.
      Consequently, it is essential that the filters be mounted in good
      thermal contact with a large thermal mass.
 
      The filter assemblies throughout the instrument incorporate
      aluminum alloy baffles located between the detectors and the
      filters to reduce the transmission of offaxis rays produced from
      reflections within the assemblies and by reflection and emission
      from the detector surfaces. These baffles, produced using EDM
      (Electrical Discharge Machining), have the same external dimensions
      as the detector arrays with individual cell walls surrounding
      each of the individual detectors. The baffles have an anodized
      coating with low large angle reflectivity that preferentially
      reduces off-axis reflections.
 
 
    Detectors and Signal Processing
    -------------------------------
      The MCS focal plane assembly A (FPA-A) comprises six arrays with
      two front-end signal read-out chips and FPA-B three arrays with one
      chip. The detector arrays are micro-machined thermopile arrays
      using Bi-Sb-Te and Bi-Te thermoelectric materials. Each pixel
      consists of a silicon-nitride membrane with twelve Bi-Sb-Te/Bi-Te
      thermocouples connected in series. These thermocouples measure the
      temperature difference between the thermally isolated absorber and
      the substrate. The detectors are coated with gold black, providing
      high absorptivity and nearly flat spectral response from 0.3 to 45
      um. During deposition, the gold black forms bridges across the
      membrane slits, thermally shorting detectors to each other and to
      the substrate. These unwanted gold black bridges are eliminated by
      laser ablation from the detector backside with 248 nm excimer laser
      radiation. The detector membrane acts a mask during this ablation
      process to confine the laser energy to the gold black bridges. It
      is necessary to remove the few remaining gold black bridges using a
      focused ion beam.
 
      The MCS observation cycle consists of two-second signal integration
      intervals, interspersed every 34 seconds with instrument views of
      space. This corresponds to a 0.03 to 0.25 Hz frequency range. Thus
      low 1/f noise in both the detectors and the readout circuitry is
      essential. Thermopile detectors intrinsically have low 1/f noise
      because when read out with high-input-impedance voltage amplifiers
      they exhibit negligible current flow. Each group of 64 detector
      pixels is read out with a custom CMOS readout integrated circuit. A
      readout chip is connected to each thermopile array with two wire
      bonds per detector pixel. The roughly DC signal from each pixel is
      modulated at 64 kHz by an electronic chopping circuit. The
      resulting AC signal is amplified, demodulated, and integrated.
      Because amplification occurs at 64 kHz rather than near DC, the 1/f
      noise in the CMOS amplifier is dramatically reduced. Integrated
      signals from 64 channels are multiplexed into a single analog
      output stream.
 
      Thermopile detector noise is dominated by Johnson noise, which, for
      the 100kOhm MCS detectors, is 40 nV/(Hz^1/2). With a 100 kOhm
      source, the readout chip has an input-referred noise of 70
      nV/(Hz^1/2) for 0.03 to 0.25 Hz. Thus the readout chip is the
      dominant focal plane noise source. Even with this readout noise,
      the MCS focal planes demonstrate D* values of 8 x 10**8
      (cmHz^1/2)/W for 0.03 to 0.25 Hz.
 
 
    Mechanisms
    ----------
      The instrument FOV can be directed over the full operating range of
      270 degrees in azimuth and elevation by stepper motor actuators.
      Twist capsule assemblies for each axis contain the stepper motors,
      gearing, position sensing diodes, and flexible leads.
 
      Both motors are brushless stepper motors with a step size of 30
      degrees, geared down by a factor of 297:1 by planetary gears and
      harmonic drives in series. The resulting step size granularity for
      instrument rotation is 0.1 degrees, or half the vertical instrument
      FOV at the limb of Mars, which corresponds to roughly one quarter
      of the atmospheric scale height (the scale-height is ~10 km).
      Encoders are not used. Instead, diodes coupled with drive phase
      information define two reference positions and software checks for
      inconsistencies between commanded and reference positions. If
      inconsistencies are detected, motor positions are re-initialized.
      Flexible leads within the twist capsule assemblies supply data,
      signal, and power connections between the OBA, the yoke, and the
      spacecraft across the moving interfaces.
 
      The motors are driven open loop by electronics in the yoke
      controlled by software. In order to minimize mean torque and
      jitter, and the possibility of induced disturbance of the
      spacecraft, instrument slews are divided into constant
      acceleration, constant velocity, and constant deceleration phases.
      The drive waveforms are micro-stepped to smooth the low frequency
      jitter produced by individual steps. Drive voltage and phase
      information that can be used to generate slews are stored in
      uploaded azimuth and elevation slew tables in MCS memory. The slew
      tables specify accelerations and decelerations of 25 degrees/s/s in
      azimuth and 42 degrees/s/s in elevation with a top speed of 26.5
      degrees/s in both axes.
 
      A complete flight spare actuator assembly was used to perform
      accelerated life testing of the MCS actuators over 3.5 x 10**6
      measurement cycles, or 5.2 x 10**8 motor revolutions. For the
      purposes of the test, a cycle consists of two opposite 90 degree
      slews. This represents a factor of two margin over the total
      anticipated elevation actuator motions during the nominal MRO
      mission of one Mars year. The life test was made more conservative
      by combining the higher number of elevation actuator cycles with
      the larger azimuth actuator mechanical load at cold (-5 degrees C),
      warm (20 degrees C), and hot (50 degrees C) operating temperature
      plateaus. The life test finished successfully in March 2006,
 
 
    Electronics and Software
    ------------------------
      The main elements of the MCS electronics are the analog, control,
      and power boards. The analog board accommodates analog signal
      processing electronics and the control board contains digital
      controller electronics. These boards are mounted on opposite sides
      of the OBA to minimize mutual interference. The power boards are
      mounted on the yoke, to isolate them from the other boards, and
      accommodate power conditioning, actuator driver, and spacecraft
      interface electronics.
 
      The core of the MCS electronics is the digital controller,
      comprising a processor coupled with 32 kBytes of RAM, 32 kBytes of
      ROM and a FPGA. Its primary functions are as follows:
 
      1. Control focal plane readout integrated circuits and digitize,
         collect, and process signals.
 
      2. Provide set-points and variable heater power for the optical
         bench and blackbody targets.
 
      3. Control housekeeping data sampling, collection, and process
         housekeeping data.
 
      4. Control the actuators.
 
      5. Receive and process spacecraft commands.
 
      6. Generate telemetry packets and transmit them to the spacecraft.
 
      7. Provide DC/DC converter synchronization and the 31.25 Hz real-

      The focal plane interface electronics digitizes the multiplexed
      integrated analog signals from the three 64-channel readout
      integrated circuit chips on the two MCS focal planes. All 192
      signals are sampled at 1 kHz, and 2048 samples are digitally
      integrated by the FPGA resulting in an effective signal integration
      period of 2.048 seconds.

  Science Objectives
  ==================
   The scientific goals of the MCS investigation are focused on defining
   and understanding the current and past climate of Mars. They include:
     (1) Global monitoring of atmospheric properties,
     (2) Characterization of the surface and subsurface thermal state
         and thermal properties,
     (3) Monitoring the annual carbon dioxide frost budget
 
    The Mars Climate Sounder observes the temperature, humidity, and
    dust content of the martian atmosphere, making measurements that
    are needed to understand Mars' current weather and climate, as
    well as potential variations that may occur.
 
    Scientists will use these measurements to understand how the
    martian atmosphere circulates and varies over time. The
    measurements will also help explain how and why the martian polar
    caps vary in response to the atmosphere and the energy input from
    the Sun.
 
 
  Calibration
  ===========
 
    In-Flight Calibration
    ---------------------
      MCS performs a two-point in-flight radiometric calibration of its
      signals, to correct for the effects of thermal drifts, using views
      of space and of calibration targets mounted on the instrument yoke.
      Views of space, accomplished by using the elevation actuator to
      slew the instrument above the limb, provide a zero reference for
      all MCS spectral channels. Space views are obtained at 34-second
      intervals during standard limb viewing observations.
 
      A second calibration point is supplied for the infrared channels by
      rotating the instrument so that the blackbody target in the yoke
      fills the aperture and FOV of both telescopes. The telescopes are
      directed toward the target approximately 10 times per orbit using
      the elevation actuator. In order to meet the MCS absolute
      radiometric calibration requirement of better than +/- 0.5% at 300 K,
      the target must be thermally uniform, and its temperature and
      emissivity known with an accuracy of better than +/- 0.25 K and
      +/- 0.0035, respectively. The required temperature and emissivity
      accuracies are met using a grooved aluminum plate, blackened by the
      Martin Black anodize process. Target temperature is monitored by
      two platinum resistance thermometers embedded at the center of each
      viewed area of the plate. One sensor is used to control the target
      temperature via a distributed heating element on the rear surface
      of the target. MCS is designed so that the blackbody target is
      mounted very close to the telescope apertures. Controlling the
      target temperature within a few degrees of the telescope
      temperature compensates, in part, for non-zero reflectivity of the
      target surface.
 
      For the visible channel, a second calibration point is provided by
      the solar target that fills the aperture of telescope A. Telescope
      A is rotated to view the solar target twice per orbit as the sun
      rises or sets over the limb of Mars. The sun is at an angle of
      roughly 15 degrees below the local horizontal for these
      measurements. The solar target diffusively scatters solar radiation
      into the telescope. In order to meet an absolute radiometric
      calibration requirement of better than +/- 3%, the target
      reflectivity must be nearly Lambertian. The target was
      characterized before launch over the expected range of viewing and
      illumination angles. It is also critical that the target surface
      reflectivity not change significantly over the lifetime of the
      mission. A textured aluminum target plate is suspended within and
      thermally isolated from a supporting base structure. A means of
      self calibration of the target is included in its design. In the
      configuration used here, the target and base form a calorimeter.
      Monitoring the target and base temperatures when the target is
      heated by the sun provides a direct indication of any changes in
      reflectivity during the mission. Corrections can then be applied to
      the instrument calibration measurements.
 
      During spacecraft system thermal vacuum testing, the MCS solar
      target was exposed to potential contamination by organics. This
      raised the question of whether the target might change, most
      probably darken, when exposed to solar UV radiation in space. The
      MRO spacecraft was configured during cruise to enable the MCS team
      to conduct two previously unscheduled tests of the solar target.
      These tests permitted a two-point intercomparison of target
      reflectivity after a total of 40-50 hours of exposure to the sun.
      Analysis of the test data demonstrated that any change in target
      reflectance is less than 0.1%.
 
 
    Post-Launch Calibration
    -----------------------
      Limited testing of MCS has been performed in Mars orbit. On 25
      March 2006, near apoapsis of the elliptical capture orbit,
      tables were up loaded and the instrument scanned Mars. The
      primary purpose of collecting scans of the planet was to
      demonstrate the capability of the MCS to support aerobraking
      planning, should it be needed.  Over a period of half an hour,
      the MCS detector arrays were scanned across the planet,
      producing a raster scan of the planet. These data are also being
      used by the team to validate the ground calibration of FOVs.
 
    Pre-Launch Calibration
    -----------------------
      MCS was operated in a stand-alone configuration under laboratory
      thermal-vacuum conditions for approximately 500 hours. During
      this time, extensive pre-flight calibration was
      performed. Radiometric calibration was accomplished using
      external high-emissivity blackbody targets controlled and
      monitored at temperatures extending over the full range of
      Martian conditions, as well as simulations of deep
      space. Detector linearity was measured for all detectors. The
      internal instrument blackbody target was calibrated. Channel
      electronic gain and offsets were established. The results of
      analyzing the calibration observations are then used, with the
      flight calibration observations, to convert the detector counts
      (EDR values) into the radiances (RDR values).
 
      The FOVs of all detectors were measured using a target
      projector, and their spectral response was determined using a
      monochrometer, both within the thermal vacuum test chamber.
 
 
  Operational Strategy / Considerations
  =====================================
    The observation strategy employed by MCS performs uninterrupted
    repetitive measurements over the life of the mission. Minimizing gaps
    in limb sounding is consistent with our objective to accumulate a
    climatology of Mars. MCS performs repetitive observations
    autonomously, utilizing an internal table-drive scheme that is
    loosely keyed to the spacecraft's latitude. The planet's aspheric
    shape and MRO orbital eccentricity are sufficient to require
    latitude dependent, although not longitudinal, adjustments to MCS
    pointing for limb-staring observations.
 
    The near-polar orbit enables MCS to use the descending (night side)
    equator crossing to synchronize its observations with spacecraft
    latitude. Ephemeris routines onboard the spacecraft are used to
    generate a command containing equator-crossing time that is
    transmitted to MCS every orbit. The acceptable error in equator-
    crossing time is 10 seconds. If equator-crossing time is not received
    by MCS, the instrument extrapolates from earlier equator crossing
    times.
 
    Articulation of MCS, and thus its pointing direction, is controlled
    by three sets of nested tables through which instrument software
    loops repetitively. Running at a top level is the Orbit Schedule
    Table (OST) that determines which of three Event Schedule Tables
    (EST) is to be used from orbit to orbit. The EST controls all
    activities over the course of an orbit and contains a list of calls
    to Scan Sequence Tables (SST) ordered by time relative to the last
    equator crossing. An SST describes a small, frequently used scan
    pattern, such as a limb view or a calibration cycle, and consists of
    a list of scanning instructions including which axis to scan, where
    to go, and how many soundings to acquire at that destination. When an
    SST completes, software determines whether to call it again or move
    on to the next SST, based on time since the last equator crossing in
    the EST. Each SST normally executes to completion so that some orbit-
    to-orbit variability in timing is introduced. Two other tables also
    modify observations round the orbit. An Elevation and Oblateness
    Correction Table (EOCT) contains a list of elevation step
    perturbations, again ordered by time relative to the last equator
    crossing. This table allows selected SSTs, such as a limb view, to be
    perturbed to track the limb by correcting for the MRO orbit and the
    oblateness of Mars. Finally, a Radio Occultation Table (ROT) contains
    the time and geometrical information needed to perturb a limb view so
    that it views the limb where and when the Earth is rising or setting
    through it.
 
    Default scan tables retained in MCS memory are utilized by instrument
    software if alternates are not uploaded following instrument turn on.
    Default SSTs enable limb viewing, with approximations for orbit
    eccentricity, to retrieve vertical profiles of temperature, dust,
    water, and condensates. These default tables also include SSTs unique
    to the polar regions where MCS performs so-called 'buckshot'
    observations: varying the angle of observation of the upward going
    radiation. Prescribed 'buckshot' patterns provide optimized
    coverage of the bi-directional reflectance function (BDRF) of the
    polar caps for determining the polar energy balance in the north and
    south. MCS also performs limb observations in the polar regions to
    provide nearly continuous atmospheric profiling. Default scan tables
    can be replaced by uploads from Earth to accommodate orbit changes,
    seasonal variations, changes in observational strategies, and
    correlative observations with other instruments or the MRO
    spacecraft. Table loads have already been used in flight to
    facilitate MCS checkouts during the cruise, including performing
    solar target calibration tests and characterizing potential
    interactions among payload elements, e.g., instrument motion-induced
    disturbances.
 
    A nadir-fixed platform is preferred by MCS. However, other elements
    of the MRO payload require the spacecraft to roll its nadir pointing
    orientation by as much as 30 degrees. Roll angles of less than 9
    degrees can be accommodated using the two detector margin at the top
    and bottom of the vertical profile. However, when the angle of
    spacecraft roll exceeds about 9 degrees, the MCS detector arrays no
    longer cover the entire vertical range of atmosphere (0 to 80 km) in
    the forward limb view. Consequently, the MRO Project Science Group
    (the formal group comprising the payload Principal Investigators) has
    undertaken to limit requests for large rolls greater than 9 degrees.
    This compromise is possible because, with planning, most surface
    targets can be viewed within 30 days using spacecraft roll angles
    less than 9 degrees. Were these practices not acceptable to the other
    MRO instrument teams, more frequent gores in MCS data would have
    seriously compromised the climatology record.
 
    These observations will disrupt the continuity of MCS measurements
    over a period of 15 minutes, or 48 degrees in latitude. To mitigate
    this problem and reduce the number and extent of incomplete vertical
    profiles, MCS can be commanded to react to rolls larger than 9
    degrees by changing its nominal observing pattern. In these cases,
    MCS alternates its FOV between two positions that together overlap
    covering the desired 0- to 80-km altitude range. Data taking will
    proceed through all roll events and calibrated radiances are flagged
    in the archive (column 10 in the EDR and column 26 in the RDR).
 
    In addition to disruptions due to spacecraft rolls, the HiRISE
    instrument needs a quiet platform from which to obtain its
    highest-resolution images. Ground testing indicates that MCS-induced
    spacecraft jitter exceeds permitted levels when either azimuth or
    elevation actuators are operated. Therefore, through a signal sent
    from the spacecraft to MCS the instrument will be commanded to
    'Freeze' for the duration of high-resolution imaging. In Freeze mode,
    MCS moves to view the limb and then remains stationary for 60-90
    seconds when it is then commanded to return to routine
    activities.  These periods are flagged in the archive in columns 8
    and 9 of the EDR or columns 24 and 25 of the RDR.]]></field>

  ===================
 
  Introduction
  ------------
    The Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) represents NASA's third attempt to
    observe Martian weather and monitor the planet's climate using
    modern infrared remote sensing techniques, including limb sounding.
 
    The campaign began in 1986 with the Pressure Modulator Infrared
    Radiometer (PMIRR) [MCCLEESEETAL1986; MCCLEESEETAL1992] on the Mars
    Observer mission, which was lost in 1993 during the final
    pressurization of the spacecraft propulsion system only a few days
    prior to Mars orbit insertion (MOI). NASA re-selected that
    scientific investigation, including an enlarged science team and
    using the same PMIRR instrument design, for another mission, the
    Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO). Launched in 1998, the MCO spacecraft
    entered the Martian atmosphere during MOI and was destroyed. NASA
    selected the same team once more to build the new MCS instrument
    now onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). MCS is not a
    copy of the PMIRR instrument launched in 1992, as the 1998 PMIRR II
    was, but is a smaller, lighter instrument with the same scientific
    objectives as those of the previous two investigations.
 
    The Mars Climate Sounder is the first custom designed infrared
    sounder for systematic meteorological measurements at Mars, using
    the limb viewing technique to obtain relatively high vertical
    resolution of better than one pressure scale height.
 
    The application of modern technology and the use of new high
    performance, linear array thermopile detectors with focal plane
    signal processing and miniature multilayer interference and mesh
    filters has permitted a fivefold reduction in mass, in part by the
    elimination of the requirement for cryogenic operation of the focal
    plane.
 
    The compact dimensions of the design allow the entire instrument to
    be pointed to limb or nadir, for atmospheric and surface mapping
    respectively, and special patterns to be implemented, for example
    for mapping over the poles where the complex physics of the energy
    balance and atmospheric response during the long winter night is to
    be addressed.
 
 
  Mars Climate Sounder Investigation
  ----------------------------------
    MCS is an investigation designed to acquire the high vertical
    resolution, horizontally contiguous measurements needed to take the
    next major step forward in understanding the Martian atmosphere.
 
    MCS will measure thermal emission from the limb of the atmosphere
    in nine spectral bands to obtain profiles with a vertical
    resolution of 5 km (approximately one half the atmospheric scale-
    height on Mars). The MCS investigation will invert accurately
    calibrated measurements of radiance in profiles extending from the
    surface to an altitude of 80 km to obtain vertical profiles of
    atmospheric temperature, water vapor abundance, and dust and
    condensate opacities. MCS will also acquire nadir and off-nadir
    observations that provide additional constraints on atmospheric
    profiles, and measurements of infrared thermal emission and
    broadband solar reflectance of the surface. In the polar regions,
    more frequent nadir and off-nadir measurements will be used to
    characterize the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere,
    which provides constraints on the rates of condensation and
    sublimation of CO2 on the surface and in the atmosphere.  Table 1
    is a high-level description of the instrument observation modes
    and the objectives that they address.

  Investigation Description
  -------------------------
   In 1999, following the failure of the MCO spacecraft,
   a major redesign of the instrument was undertaken by the
   science team. The result is a much-reduced instrument mass,
   a smaller footprint on the payload deck, fewer mechanisms,
   and lower power requirements. PMIRR was a 44-kg instrument
   consuming 40 W. MCS weighs 9 kg and consumes
   11 W of continuous power.
 
   The availability of new high performance, linear array thermopile
   detectors with focal plane signal processing [FOOTEETAL2003] was
   the key that made possible a much-simplified design for MCS without
   compromising performance.
 
 
  Measurement Approach
  --------------------
    MCS employs a nearly continuous limb viewing strategy in order to
    achieve greatly increased sensitivity to minor and trace
    constituents, the atmospheric limb path length being approximately
    50 times that of a nadir view on Mars. The vertical resolution is
    also improved compared with the vertical resolution achievable by
    nadir viewing instruments. Martian targets of interest to the MCS
    investigation are typically low radiance, such as the cold
    low emittance atmosphere and low temperature surfaces (<150 K in
    the polar night). This is another factor that led to the
    selection of a radiometer design that favors large energy grasp
    over spectral resolution. MCS measurements are made in nine
    spectral intervals with 20 cm-1 and broader spectral passbands in
    the range 0.3 - 45 um; see Table 2.

  Instrument Specifications
  =========================
 
    Overview
    --------
      The instrument consists of an optical bench assembly (OBA),
      containing the optics bench, telescopes, and analog and digital
      electronics boards, suspended from a yoke via the elevation
      actuator. The yoke supports the instrument, accommodates instrument
      calibration targets and power conditioning and drive electronics,
      and provides the mechanical and electrical interface with the
      spacecraft via a twist-capsule mounted on the azimuth actuator. A
      similar twist capsule, mounted on the elevation actuator assembly,
      conveys power and signals between the yoke and OBA electronics.
      Table 3 summarizes the primary physical and operational parameters
      of the instrument.

      The entire MCS optical bench is articulated in two axes in order

      articulation is 270 degrees in both azimuth and elevation axes
      providing views of the full hemisphere beneath the nadir-pointed
      payload platform.
 
      Each telescope consists of mirrors and a focal plane assembly
      supported by a metering structure, which is suspended within the
      instrument optical bench. The two identical MCS telescopes are
      differentiated primarily by their focal planes. Telescope A has a
      focal plane with six spectral channels, labeled A1 through A6 in
      Table 2. These visible and mid-IR channels are defined spectrally
      by optical interference filters mounted over six, 21-element linear
      thermopile detector arrays. The telescope B focal plane has three
      far-infrared spectral channels, defined spectrally by conductive
      mesh filters mounted over three detector arrays.
 
      Each MCS focal plane assembly consists of a detector chip, focal
      plane signal processing chips, and a bandpass filter assembly, all
      mounted on a focal plane block.
 
 
    Instrument Optical Design / Telescopes
    --------------------------------------
      The telescopes are of identical design. Both are off-axis, all-
      reflective, telecentric with 4 cm apertures, FOVs of 4.3 degrees,
      and comprising three mirrors. The telescopes are mounted with
      parallel optical axes; rotated 180 degrees relative to each other
      about their prime axes. The instrument aperture is
      defined by the perimeter of the secondary mirror and the tertiary
      mirror focuses an f/1.7 beam through band-pass filters and baffles
      on to the focal plane detectors. The baffles, mounted close to the
      back surfaces of the filters, act as light pipes for the detectors
      and define the FOV response of the individual detector elements.
      Limb-sounding atmospheric measurements with the resolution required
      by MCS place fairly modest requirements on image quality but are
      strongly influenced by the far wings of the FOV response in the
      vertical direction. Focal plane baffles reduce FOV response wings
      produced by scattering within the filters and by thermal radiation
      re-emitted from the detectors. Also, the secondary mirror is
      apodized at the edges, using deposited gold black, to reduce FOV
      wings caused by diffraction at the longer wavelengths.
 
      The telescope mirrors are diamond turned from nickel-plated
      aluminum and post-polished to reduce scattering at visible
      wavelengths. The reflective surface is a silicon dioxide-protected
      aluminum coating, chosen for its reflectivity at both visible and
      infrared wavelengths and its robustness. The aluminum metering
      structure supports the mirrors and its internal surfaces form
      baffles that shield the space between the tertiary mirror and the
      focal plane. An external baffle, mounted on the optical bench,
      prevents stray light reaching the focal plane after only one
      reflection. All the exposed internal surfaces of the metering
      structure and external baffle are treated with Martin Black to
      reduce scattering. Alignment tolerances for the MCS telescope
      permit a 'snap together' design, although provisions are made for
      shimming the primary mirror and focal plane. In practice, only the
      focal plane is adjusted to achieve best focus.
 
      Because MCS is an unchopped radiometer, considerable care is taken
      to minimize thermal drifts in the telescope and focal plane
      assembly. The primary source of variable radiant energy that will
      tend to destabilize the instrument temperature is exposure, once
      per orbit, to the large day-night contrast in solar illumination
      and Martian surface temperature. High thermal stability is achieved
      in MCS by maximizing the thermal mass of the telescope, maximizing
      the thermal conductivity between its component parts, and
      conductively isolating the telescopes from the surrounding optical
      bench, which sees most of the variable environmental heat load from
      the instrument thermal blankets and external baffles. The MCS
      telescopes are each mounted at three points to the optical bench
      via struts with flextures. Conductive isolation between the struts
      and optical bench is provided by fiberglass (G10) washers.
      Temperature control is applied to the optical bench, which acts as
      a stable radiative 'oven' for the telescopes and focal planes.
      The stable thermal environment, all aluminum mirrors and metering
      structure, and flextured interfaces with the optical bench and
      focal plane assembly also minimize thermal distortion in telescope
      alignment.
 
 
    Focal Plane Filters
    -------------------
      The spectral passbands of MCS are defined using individual spectral
      filters mounted in metal frames in front of each of the 9 detector
      arrays. For telescope A, the five mid-infrared filters in the focal
      plane cover the 11.8- to 22.2-um wavelength range (channels A1
      through A5). These are multilayer interference filters manufactured
      by the University of Reading, UK. Germanium was the substrate
      material of choice for the five mid-infrared filters (A1 through
      A5) because of its robust mechanical properties and high optical
      transmission over the full spectral range. The germanium absorption
      band near 20 um was not a major concern because the substrates are
      very thin. The multilayer filters are of conventional design but
      they are unusually small and five filters must fit directly over
      the MCS focal plane. Small filters are cut from a larger substrate.
      Good yield was achieved with this approach with little chipping or
      other damage to the substrates or coatings. The broadband 0.3 to 3
      um filter, A6, is made of UV22 glass, chosen for its blocking from
      3 to 5 um.
 
      The three far infrared filters in focal plane B consist of stacks
      of mesh filters developed by Cardiff University. The same group
      successfully produced air spaced mesh filters for the PMIRR
      instruments. Cardiff produced a 'hot pressed' version of their
      filters consisting of copper meshes on polypropylene substrates,
      which can be cut to fit the smaller MCS filter frames.
 
      Thermal stability of all the spectral filters is critical. The MCS
      thermopile arrays respond to radiation at all wavelengths where
      their surfaces absorb, i.e., where gold black has low reflectivity.
      Small excursions in the temperature of the filters will produce
      measurable signals, because the filters themselves are sources of
      blackbody radiation at all wavelengths away from their narrow
      spectral windows. Temperature changes in the filters due to the
      changing scene, e.g., Mars and the limb of the atmosphere, are
      potentially large enough to cause a measurable, but spurious,
      effect. Note that the filters fill nearly the whole 2pi FOV of the
      detector. A change in the temperature of 5 mK produces a spurious
      signal equivalent to a 1% true signal change in channel A3.
      Consequently, it is essential that the filters be mounted in good
      thermal contact with a large thermal mass.
 
      The filter assemblies throughout the instrument incorporate
      aluminum alloy baffles located between the detectors and the
      filters to reduce the transmission of offaxis rays produced from
      reflections within the assemblies and by reflection and emission
      from the detector surfaces. These baffles, produced using EDM
      (Electrical Discharge Machining), have the same external dimensions
      as the detector arrays with individual cell walls surrounding
      each of the individual detectors. The baffles have an anodized
      coating with low large angle reflectivity that preferentially
      reduces off-axis reflections.
 
 
    Detectors and Signal Processing
    -------------------------------
      The MCS focal plane assembly A (FPA-A) comprises six arrays with
      two front-end signal read-out chips and FPA-B three arrays with one
      chip. The detector arrays are micro-machined thermopile arrays
      using Bi-Sb-Te and Bi-Te thermoelectric materials. Each pixel
      consists of a silicon-nitride membrane with twelve Bi-Sb-Te/Bi-Te
      thermocouples connected in series. These thermocouples measure the
      temperature difference between the thermally isolated absorber and
      the substrate. The detectors are coated with gold black, providing
      high absorptivity and nearly flat spectral response from 0.3 to 45
      um. During deposition, the gold black forms bridges across the
      membrane slits, thermally shorting detectors to each other and to
      the substrate. These unwanted gold black bridges are eliminated by
      laser ablation from the detector backside with 248 nm excimer laser
      radiation. The detector membrane acts a mask during this ablation
      process to confine the laser energy to the gold black bridges. It
      is necessary to remove the few remaining gold black bridges using a
      focused ion beam.
 
      The MCS observation cycle consists of two-second signal integration
      intervals, interspersed every 34 seconds with instrument views of
      space. This corresponds to a 0.03 to 0.25 Hz frequency range. Thus
      low 1/f noise in both the detectors and the readout circuitry is
      essential. Thermopile detectors intrinsically have low 1/f noise
      because when read out with high-input-impedance voltage amplifiers
      they exhibit negligible current flow. Each group of 64 detector
      pixels is read out with a custom CMOS readout integrated circuit. A
      readout chip is connected to each thermopile array with two wire
      bonds per detector pixel. The roughly DC signal from each pixel is
      modulated at 64 kHz by an electronic chopping circuit. The
      resulting AC signal is amplified, demodulated, and integrated.
      Because amplification occurs at 64 kHz rather than near DC, the 1/f
      noise in the CMOS amplifier is dramatically reduced. Integrated
      signals from 64 channels are multiplexed into a single analog
      output stream.
 
      Thermopile detector noise is dominated by Johnson noise, which, for
      the 100kOhm MCS detectors, is 40 nV/(Hz^1/2). With a 100 kOhm
      source, the readout chip has an input-referred noise of 70
      nV/(Hz^1/2) for 0.03 to 0.25 Hz. Thus the readout chip is the
      dominant focal plane noise source. Even with this readout noise,
      the MCS focal planes demonstrate D* values of 8 x 10**8
      (cmHz^1/2)/W for 0.03 to 0.25 Hz.
 
 
    Mechanisms
    ----------
      The instrument FOV can be directed over the full operating range of
      270 degrees in azimuth and elevation by stepper motor actuators.
      Twist capsule assemblies for each axis contain the stepper motors,
      gearing, position sensing diodes, and flexible leads.
 
      Both motors are brushless stepper motors with a step size of 30
      degrees, geared down by a factor of 297:1 by planetary gears and
      harmonic drives in series. The resulting step size granularity for
      instrument rotation is 0.1 degrees, or half the vertical instrument
      FOV at the limb of Mars, which corresponds to roughly one quarter
      of the atmospheric scale height (the scale-height is ~10 km).
      Encoders are not used. Instead, diodes coupled with drive phase
      information define two reference positions and software checks for
      inconsistencies between commanded and reference positions. If
      inconsistencies are detected, motor positions are re-initialized.
      Flexible leads within the twist capsule assemblies supply data,
      signal, and power connections between the OBA, the yoke, and the
      spacecraft across the moving interfaces.
 
      The motors are driven open loop by electronics in the yoke
      controlled by software. In order to minimize mean torque and
      jitter, and the possibility of induced disturbance of the
      spacecraft, instrument slews are divided into constant
      acceleration, constant velocity, and constant deceleration phases.
      The drive waveforms are micro-stepped to smooth the low frequency
      jitter produced by individual steps. Drive voltage and phase
      information that can be used to generate slews are stored in
      uploaded azimuth and elevation slew tables in MCS memory. The slew
      tables specify accelerations and decelerations of 25 degrees/s/s in
      azimuth and 42 degrees/s/s in elevation with a top speed of 26.5
      degrees/s in both axes.
 
      A complete flight spare actuator assembly was used to perform
      accelerated life testing of the MCS actuators over 3.5 x 10**6
      measurement cycles, or 5.2 x 10**8 motor revolutions. For the
      purposes of the test, a cycle consists of two opposite 90 degree
      slews. This represents a factor of two margin over the total
      anticipated elevation actuator motions during the nominal MRO
      mission of one Mars year. The life test was made more conservative
      by combining the higher number of elevation actuator cycles with
      the larger azimuth actuator mechanical load at cold (-5 degrees C),
      warm (20 degrees C), and hot (50 degrees C) operating temperature
      plateaus. The life test finished successfully in March 2006,
 
 
    Electronics and Software
    ------------------------
      The main elements of the MCS electronics are the analog, control,
      and power boards. The analog board accommodates analog signal
      processing electronics and the control board contains digital
      controller electronics. These boards are mounted on opposite sides
      of the OBA to minimize mutual interference. The power boards are
      mounted on the yoke, to isolate them from the other boards, and
      accommodate power conditioning, actuator driver, and spacecraft
      interface electronics.
 
      The core of the MCS electronics is the digital controller,
      comprising a processor coupled with 32 kBytes of RAM, 32 kBytes of
      ROM and a FPGA. Its primary functions are as follows:
 
      1. Control focal plane readout integrated circuits and digitize,
         collect, and process signals.
 
      2. Provide set-points and variable heater power for the optical
         bench and blackbody targets.
 
      3. Control housekeeping data sampling, collection, and process
         housekeeping data.
 
      4. Control the actuators.
 
      5. Receive and process spacecraft commands.
 
      6. Generate telemetry packets and transmit them to the spacecraft.
 
      7. Provide DC/DC converter synchronization and the 31.25 Hz real-
         time clock.
 
      The focal plane interface electronics digitizes the multiplexed
      integrated analog signals from the three 64-channel readout
      integrated circuit chips on the two MCS focal planes. All 192
      signals are sampled at 1 kHz, and 2048 samples are digitally
      integrated by the FPGA resulting in an effective signal integration
      period of 2.048 seconds.

  Science Objectives
  ==================
   The scientific goals of the MCS investigation are focused on defining
   and understanding the current and past climate of Mars. They include:
     (1) Global monitoring of atmospheric properties,
     (2) Characterization of the surface and subsurface thermal state
         and thermal properties,
     (3) Monitoring the annual carbon dioxide frost budget
 
    The Mars Climate Sounder observes the temperature, humidity, and
    dust content of the martian atmosphere, making measurements that
    are needed to understand Mars' current weather and climate, as
    well as potential variations that may occur.
 
    Scientists will use these measurements to understand how the
    martian atmosphere circulates and varies over time. The
    measurements will also help explain how and why the martian polar
    caps vary in response to the atmosphere and the energy input from
    the Sun.
 
 
  Calibration
  ===========
 
    In-Flight Calibration
    ---------------------
      MCS performs a two-point in-flight radiometric calibration of its
      signals, to correct for the effects of thermal drifts, using views
      of space and of calibration targets mounted on the instrument yoke.
      Views of space, accomplished by using the elevation actuator to
      slew the instrument above the limb, provide a zero reference for
      all MCS spectral channels. Space views are obtained at 34-second
      intervals during standard limb viewing observations.
 
      A second calibration point is supplied for the infrared channels by
      rotating the instrument so that the blackbody target in the yoke
      fills the aperture and FOV of both telescopes. The telescopes are
      directed toward the target approximately 10 times per orbit using
      the elevation actuator. In order to meet the MCS absolute
      radiometric calibration requirement of better than +/- 0.5% at 300 K,
      the target must be thermally uniform, and its temperature and
      emissivity known with an accuracy of better than +/- 0.25 K and
      +/- 0.0035, respectively. The required temperature and emissivity
      accuracies are met using a grooved aluminum plate, blackened by the
      Martin Black anodize process. Target temperature is monitored by
      two platinum resistance thermometers embedded at the center of each
      viewed area of the plate. One sensor is used to control the target
      temperature via a distributed heating element on the rear surface
      of the target. MCS is designed so that the blackbody target is
      mounted very close to the telescope apertures. Controlling the
      target temperature within a few degrees of the telescope
      temperature compensates, in part, for non-zero reflectivity of the
      target surface.
 
      For the visible channel, a second calibration point is provided by
      the solar target that fills the aperture of telescope A. Telescope
      A is rotated to view the solar target twice per orbit as the sun
      rises or sets over the limb of Mars. The sun is at an angle of
      roughly 15 degrees below the local horizontal for these
      measurements. The solar target diffusively scatters solar radiation
      into the telescope. In order to meet an absolute radiometric
      calibration requirement of better than +/- 3%, the target
      reflectivity must be nearly Lambertian. The target was
      characterized before launch over the expected range of viewing and
      illumination angles. It is also critical that the target surface
      reflectivity not change significantly over the lifetime of the
      mission. A textured aluminum target plate is suspended within and
      thermally isolated from a supporting base structure. A means of
      self calibration of the target is included in its design. In the
      configuration used here, the target and base form a calorimeter.
      Monitoring the target and base temperatures when the target is
      heated by the sun provides a direct indication of any changes in
      reflectivity during the mission. Corrections can then be applied to
      the instrument calibration measurements.
 
      During spacecraft system thermal vacuum testing, the MCS solar
      target was exposed to potential contamination by organics. This
      raised the question of whether the target might change, most
      probably darken, when exposed to solar UV radiation in space. The
      MRO spacecraft was configured during cruise to enable the MCS team
      to conduct two previously unscheduled tests of the solar target.
      These tests permitted a two-point intercomparison of target
      reflectivity after a total of 40-50 hours of exposure to the sun.
      Analysis of the test data demonstrated that any change in target
      reflectance is less than 0.1%.
 
 
    Post-Launch Calibration
    -----------------------
      Limited testing of MCS has been performed in Mars orbit. On 25
      March 2006, near apoapsis of the elliptical capture orbit,
      tables were up loaded and the instrument scanned Mars. The
      primary purpose of collecting scans of the planet was to
      demonstrate the capability of the MCS to support aerobraking
      planning, should it be needed.  Over a period of half an hour,
      the MCS detector arrays were scanned across the planet,
      producing a raster scan of the planet. These data are also being
      used by the team to validate the ground calibration of FOVs.
 
    Pre-Launch Calibration
    -----------------------
      MCS was operated in a stand-alone configuration under laboratory
      thermal-vacuum conditions for approximately 500 hours. During
      this time, extensive pre-flight calibration was
      performed. Radiometric calibration was accomplished using
      external high-emissivity blackbody targets controlled and
      monitored at temperatures extending over the full range of
      Martian conditions, as well as simulations of deep
      space. Detector linearity was measured for all detectors. The
      internal instrument blackbody target was calibrated. Channel
      electronic gain and offsets were established. The results of
      analyzing the calibration observations are then used, with the
      flight calibration observations, to convert the detector counts
      (EDR values) into the radiances (RDR values).
 
      The FOVs of all detectors were measured using a target
      projector, and their spectral response was determined using a
      monochrometer, both within the thermal vacuum test chamber.
 
 
  Operational Strategy / Considerations
  =====================================
    The observation strategy employed by MCS performs uninterrupted
    repetitive measurements over the life of the mission. Minimizing gaps
    in limb sounding is consistent with our objective to accumulate a
    climatology of Mars. MCS performs repetitive observations
    autonomously, utilizing an internal table-drive scheme that is
    loosely keyed to the spacecraft's latitude. The planet's aspheric
    shape and MRO orbital eccentricity are sufficient to require
    latitude dependent, although not longitudinal, adjustments to MCS
    pointing for limb-staring observations.
 
    The near-polar orbit enables MCS to use the descending (night side)
    equator crossing to synchronize its observations with spacecraft
    latitude. Ephemeris routines onboard the spacecraft are used to
    generate a command containing equator-crossing time that is
    transmitted to MCS every orbit. The acceptable error in equator-
    crossing time is 10 seconds. If equator-crossing time is not received
    by MCS, the instrument extrapolates from earlier equator crossing
    times.
 
    Articulation of MCS, and thus its pointing direction, is controlled
    by three sets of nested tables through which instrument software
    loops repetitively. Running at a top level is the Orbit Schedule
    Table (OST) that determines which of three Event Schedule Tables
    (EST) is to be used from orbit to orbit. The EST controls all
    activities over the course of an orbit and contains a list of calls
    to Scan Sequence Tables (SST) ordered by time relative to the last
    equator crossing. An SST describes a small, frequently used scan
    pattern, such as a limb view or a calibration cycle, and consists of
    a list of scanning instructions including which axis to scan, where
    to go, and how many soundings to acquire at that destination. When an
    SST completes, software determines whether to call it again or move
    on to the next SST, based on time since the last equator crossing in
    the EST. Each SST normally executes to completion so that some orbit-
    to-orbit variability in timing is introduced. Two other tables also
    modify observations round the orbit. An Elevation and Oblateness
    Correction Table (EOCT) contains a list of elevation step
    perturbations, again ordered by time relative to the last equator
    crossing. This table allows selected SSTs, such as a limb view, to be
    perturbed to track the limb by correcting for the MRO orbit and the
    oblateness of Mars. Finally, a Radio Occultation Table (ROT) contains
    the time and geometrical information needed to perturb a limb view so
    that it views the limb where and when the Earth is rising or setting
    through it.
 
    Default scan tables retained in MCS memory are utilized by instrument
    software if alternates are not uploaded following instrument turn on.
    Default SSTs enable limb viewing, with approximations for orbit
    eccentricity, to retrieve vertical profiles of temperature, dust,
    water, and condensates. These default tables also include SSTs unique
    to the polar regions where MCS performs so-called 'buckshot'
    observations: varying the angle of observation of the upward going
    radiation. Prescribed 'buckshot' patterns provide optimized
    coverage of the bi-directional reflectance function (BDRF) of the
    polar caps for determining the polar energy balance in the north and
    south. MCS also performs limb observations in the polar regions to
    provide nearly continuous atmospheric profiling. Default scan tables
    can be replaced by uploads from Earth to accommodate orbit changes,
    seasonal variations, changes in observational strategies, and
    correlative observations with other instruments or the MRO
    spacecraft. Table loads have already been used in flight to
    facilitate MCS checkouts during the cruise, including performing
    solar target calibration tests and characterizing potential
    interactions among payload elements, e.g., instrument motion-induced
    disturbances.
 
    A nadir-fixed platform is preferred by MCS. However, other elements
    of the MRO payload require the spacecraft to roll its nadir pointing
    orientation by as much as 30 degrees. Roll angles of less than 9
    degrees can be accommodated using the two detector margin at the top
    and bottom of the vertical profile. However, when the angle of
    spacecraft roll exceeds about 9 degrees, the MCS detector arrays no
    longer cover the entire vertical range of atmosphere (0 to 80 km) in
    the forward limb view. Consequently, the MRO Project Science Group
    (the formal group comprising the payload Principal Investigators) has
    undertaken to limit requests for large rolls greater than 9 degrees.
    This compromise is possible because, with planning, most surface
    targets can be viewed within 30 days using spacecraft roll angles
    less than 9 degrees. Were these practices not acceptable to the other
    MRO instrument teams, more frequent gores in MCS data would have
    seriously compromised the climatology record.
 
    These observations will disrupt the continuity of MCS measurements
    over a period of 15 minutes, or 48 degrees in latitude. To mitigate
    this problem and reduce the number and extent of incomplete vertical
    profiles, MCS can be commanded to react to rolls larger than 9
    degrees by changing its nominal observing pattern. In these cases,
    MCS alternates its FOV between two positions that together overlap
    covering the desired 0- to 80-km altitude range. Data taking will
    proceed through all roll events and calibrated radiances are flagged
    in the archive (column 10 in the EDR and column 26 in the RDR).
 
    In addition to disruptions due to spacecraft rolls, the HiRISE
    instrument needs a quiet platform from which to obtain its
    highest-resolution images. Ground testing indicates that MCS-induced
    spacecraft jitter exceeds permitted levels when either azimuth or
    elevation actuators are operated. Therefore, through a signal sent
    from the spacecraft to MCS the instrument will be commanded to
    'Freeze' for the duration of high-resolution imaging. In Freeze mode,
    MCS moves to view the limb and then remains stationary for 60-90
    seconds when it is then commanded to return to routine
    activities.  These periods are flagged in the archive in columns 8
    and 9 of the EDR or columns 24 and 25 of the RDR.]]></field>

  ========================
    The Apollo 12 Command and Service Module (CSM) spacecraft orbited the
    Moon during the Apollo 12  mission.  It was piloted by Richard F.
    Gordon.
 
 
    Spacecraft and Subsystems
    -------------------------
      As the name implies, the Command and Service Module (CSM) for the
      Apollo 12 mission was comprised of two distinct units:  the Command
      Module (CM), which housed the crew, spacecraft operations systems,
      and re-entry equipment, and the Service Module (SM) which carried
      most of the consumables (oxygen, water, helium, fuel cells, and fuel)
      and the main propulsion system. The total length of the two modules
      attached was 11.0 meters with a maximum diameter of 3.9 meters.
      Block II CSM's were used for all the crewed Apollo missions.  The
      launch mass, including propellants and expendables, of the Apollo 12
      CSM was 28,790 kg of which the Command Module (CM-108) had a mass of
      5609 kg and the Service Module (SM-108) 23,181 kg.  The Apollo 12 CM
      was named ''Yankee Clipper''.
 
      Telecommunications included voice, television, data, and tracking and
      ranging subsystems for communications between astronauts, CM, LM, and
      Earth.  Voice contact was provided by an S-band uplink and downlink
      system.  Tracking was done through a unified S-band transponder.  A
      high gain steerable S-band antenna consisting of four 79-cm diameter
      parabolic dishes was mounted on a folding boom at the aft end of the
      SM.  Two VHF scimitar antennas were also mounted on the SM.  There
      was also a VHF recovery beacon mounted in the CM.  The CSM
      environmental control system regulated cabin atmosphere, pressure,
      temperature, carbon dioxide, odors, particles, and ventilation and
      controlled the temperature range of the electronic equipment.
 
 
    Command Module
    --------------
      The CM was a conical pressure vessel with a maximum diameter of 3.9 m
      at its base and a height of 3.65 m.  It was made of an aluminum
      honeycomb sandwich bonded between sheet aluminum alloy.  The base of
      the CM consisted of a heat shield made of brazed stainless steel
      honeycomb filled with a phenolic epoxy resin as an ablative material
      and varied in thickness from 1.8 to 6.9 cm.  At the tip of the cone
      was a hatch and docking assembly designed to mate with the lunar
      module.  The CM was divided into three compartments.  The forward
      compartment in the nose of the cone held the three 25.4 m diameter
      main parachutes, two 5 m drogue parachutes, and pilot mortar chutes
      for Earth landing.  The aft compartment was situated around the base
      of the CM and contained propellant tanks, reaction control engines,
      wiring, and plumbing.  The crew compartment comprised most of the
      volume of the CM, approximately 6.17 cubic meters of space.  Three
      astronaut couches were lined up facing forward in the center of the
      compartment.  A large access hatch was situated above the center
      couch.  A short access tunnel led to the docking hatch in the CM
      nose. The crew compartment held the controls, displays, navigation
      equipment and other systems used by the astronauts.  The CM had five
      windows: one in the access hatch, one next to each astronaut in the
      two outer seats, and two forward-facing rendezvous windows.  Five
      silver/zinc-oxide batteries provided power after the CM and SM
      detached, three for re-entry and after landing and two for vehicle
      separation and parachute deployment.  The CM had twelve 420 N
      nitrogen tetroxide/hydrazine reaction control thrusters.  The CM
      provided the re-entry capability at the end of the mission after
      separation from the Service Module.
 
 
    Service Module
    --------------
      The SM was a cylinder 3.9 meters in diameter and 7.6 m long which was
      attached to the back of the CM. The outer skin of the SM was formed
      of 2.5 cm thick aluminum honeycomb panels.  The interior was divided
      by milled aluminum radial beams into six sections around a central
      cylinder.  At the back of the SM mounted in the central cylinder was
      a gimbal mounted restartable hypergolic liquid propellant 91,000 N
      engine and cone shaped engine nozzle.  Attitude control was provided
      by four identical banks of four 450 N reaction control thrusters each
      spaced 90 degrees apart around the forward part of the SM.  The six
      sections of the SM held three 31-cell hydrogen oxygen fuel cells
      which provided 28 volts, two cryogenic oxygen and two cryogenic
      hydrogen tanks, four tanks for the main propulsion engine, two for
      fuel and two for oxidizer, and the subsystems the main propulsion
      unit.  Two helium tanks were mounted in the central cylinder.
      Electrical power system radiators were at the top of the cylinder and
      environmental control radiator panels spaced around the bottom.
 
 
    Scientific Experiments
    ----------------------
      The following scientific experiments were performed on board the
      Apollo 12 Command and Service Module:
 
      - The Photography Experiment (1) obtained photographs of the
        transposition, docking, lunar module ejection maneuver, and the LM
        rendezvous sequence from both the command and lunar modules, (2)
        obtained photos of the lunar ground track and of the landing site
        from the low point of the LM's flight path, (3) recorded the
        operational activities of the crew, (4) obtained long-distance
        earth and lunar terrain photographs with 70-mm still cameras, and
        (5) obtained photos of lunar surface features and of the activities
        of the astronauts who landed on the Moon.
 
      - The Multispectral Photography Experiment obtained photographs
        showing lunar surface color variations for use in geologic mapping
        and correlation with surface samples from spectral reflectance.
 
      - The Window Meteoroid Detector Experiment used the CM heat shield
        window surfaces (fused silica) to obtain information about the flux
        of meteoroids with masses of 1 nanogram or less.  About 0.4 square
        meters of the window surfaces were used as meteoroid impact
        detectors.
 
      - The S-Band Transponder Experiment measured the lunar gravitational
        field by observing the dynamical motion of the spacecraft in free
        fall orbits to provide information about the distribution of lunar
        mass.
 
    For more information about the CSM and its experiments, see the Apollo
    12 preliminary science report (1970) [APOLLO12A1970] and the report
    ''Apollo 12, A New Vista for Lunar Science'' (1970) [APOLLO12B1970].

  ========================
    The Apollo 15 lunar module (LM) 'Falcon' was the fourth crewed
    vehicle to land on the Moon.  It carried two astronauts, Commander
    David R. Scott and LM pilot James B. Irwin, the seventh and eighth men
    to walk on the Moon.  The LM also carried a Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV),
    an Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) that contained
    scientific experiments to be deployed and left on the lunar surface,
    and other scientific and sample collection apparatus.  The experiments
    performed on the Moon, in addition to the ALSEP suite, were geologic
    sample collection, surface photography, soil mechanics investigations
    to study physical properties of the lunar regolith, and the solar wind
    composition experiment which collected samples of solar wind particles
    for return to Earth.
 
    The LM separated from the Command and Service Module (CSM) at 18:13:30
    UT and landed at 22:16:29 UT (6:16:29 p.m. EDT) on 30 July 1971 in the
    Mare Imbrium region at the foot of the Apennine mountain range at
    26.1322 N latitude, 3.6339 E longitude (IAU Mean Earth Polar Axis
    coordinate system [DAVIES&COLVIN2000]).  Scott and Irwin made three
    moonwalk extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) totaling 18 hours, 35
    minutes. During this time they covered 27.9 km and collected 77.31 kg
    of rock and soil samples.  The LRV was used to explore regions within 5
    km of the LM landing site. This was the first time a vehicle of this
    type had been used, and its performance on the lunar terrain was very
    successful.  Two hours after landing the cabin was depressurized and
    Scott performed a standup EVA for 33 minutes, describing and
    photographing the surrounding terrain from the LM upper hatch.
 
    The first moonwalk EVA was on 31 July from 13:13:10 UT to 19:45:59 UT,
    during which time the LRV was unloaded, deployed, and driven.
    Photographs of the lunar surface were taken and geologic samples were
    collected from the LM site and during the three geological traverses.
    The traverse on the first EVA covered 10.3 km to the edge of Hadley
    Rille to Elbow Crater and near St. George Crater and back to the LM,
    where a core sample was taken from three meters below the surface.  The
    ALSEP was deployed at the end of the traverse.  On the second EVA, on 1
    August from 11:48:48 UT to 19:01:02 UT, the LRV was driven on a 12.5 km
    traverse southeast along the base of the Apennine Mountains near Index,
    Arbeit, Crescent, Dune, and Spur craters and back to the ALSEP site.
    On the third EVA on 2 August from 08:52:14 UT to 13:42:04 UT the LRV
    was driven a total of 5.1 km west to Scarp Crater and northwest along
    the edge of Hadley Rille and back east across the mare.  After the
    final EVA Scott performed a televised demonstration of a hammer and
    feather falling at the same rate in the lunar vacuum.  The astronauts
    also left a plaque and small figure on the surface in memory of all
    fourteen American and Soviet space explorers who had died during the
    two nation's space programs.
 
    The LM lifted off the Moon on 2 August at 17:11:22 UT after 66 hours,
    55 minutes on the lunar surface.  After docking with the CSM (piloted
    by Alfred M. Worden) at 19:09:47 UT, the LM was jettisoned on 3 August
    at 01:04:14 UT and impacted on the Moon 2 hours later (03:03:37.0 UT)
    at 26.36 N, 0.25 E, 93 km west of the Apollo 15 ALSEP site, with an
    estimated impact velocity of 1.7 km/s at an angle of about 3.2 degrees
    from horizontal.
 
 
    Lunar Module Spacecraft and Subsystems
    --------------------------------------
      The lunar module was a two-stage vehicle designed for space
      operations near and on the Moon.  The spacecraft mass of 16,434 kg
      was the mass of the LM including astronauts, expendables, and
      approximately 12,000 kg of propellants.  The fully fueled mass of the
      ascent stage was about 4971 kg and the descent stage 11,463 kg.  The
      ascent and descent stages of the LM operated as a unit until staging,
      when the ascent stage functioned as a single spacecraft for
      rendezvous and docking with the command and service module (CSM).
      The descent stage comprised the lower part of the spacecraft and was
      an octagonal prism 4.2 meters across and 1.7 m thick.  Four landing
      legs with round footpads were mounted on the sides of the descent
      stage and held the bottom of the stage 1.5 m above the surface.  The
      distance between the ends of the footpads on opposite landing legs
      was 9.4 m. One of the legs had a small astronaut egress platform and
      ladder.  A one meter long conical descent engine skirt protruded from
      the bottom of the stage.  The descent stage contained the landing
      rocket, two tanks of aerozine 50 fuel, two tanks of nitrogen
      tetroxide oxidizer, water, oxygen and helium tanks and storage space
      for the lunar equipment and experiments, and in the case of Apollo
      15, 16, and 17, the lunar rover.  The descent stage served as a
      platform for launching the ascent stage and was left behind on the
      Moon.
 
      The ascent stage was an irregularly shaped unit approximately 2.8 m
      high and 4.0 by 4.3 meters in width mounted on top of the descent
      stage.  The ascent stage housed the astronauts in a pressurized crew
      compartment with a volume of 6.65 cubic meters.  There was an
      ingress-egress hatch in one side and a docking hatch for connecting
      to the CSM on top.  Also mounted along the top were a parabolic
      rendezvous radar antenna, a steerable parabolic S-band antenna, and 2
      in-flight VHF antennas.  Two triangular windows were above and to
      either side of the egress hatch and four thrust chamber assemblies
      were mounted around the sides.  At the base of the assembly was the
      ascent engine.  The stage also contained an aerozine 50 fuel and an
      oxidizer tank, and helium, liquid oxygen, gaseous oxygen, and
      reaction control fuel tanks.  There were no seats in the LM.  A
      control console was mounted in the front of the crew compartment
      above the ingress-egress hatch and between the windows and two more
      control panels mounted on the side walls.  The ascent stage was
      launched from the Moon at the end of lunar surface operations and
      returned the astronauts to the CSM.
 
      The descent engine was a deep-throttling ablative rocket with a
      maximum thrust of about 45,000 N mounted on a gimbal ring in the
      center of the descent stage.  The ascent engine was a fixed,
      constant-thrust rocket with a thrust of about 15,000 N.  Maneuvering
      was achieved via the reaction control system, which consisted of the
      four thrust modules, each one composed of four 450 N thrust chambers
      and nozzles pointing in different directions.  Telemetry, TV, voice,
      and range communications with Earth were all via the S-band antenna.
      VHF was used for communications between the astronauts and the LM,
      and the LM and orbiting CSM.  There were redundant transceivers and
      equipment for both S-band and VHF.  An environmental control system
      recycled oxygen and maintained temperature in the electronics and
      cabin.  Power was provided by 6 silver-zinc batteries.  Guidance and
      navigation control were provided by a radar ranging system, an
      inertial measurement unit consisting of gyroscopes and
      accelerometers, and the Apollo guidance computer.
 
 
    Scientific Experiments
    ----------------------
      The following scientific experiments were performed on board or at
      the Apollo 15 Lunar Module:
 
      - Handheld Photography documented the deployment of experiments,
        augmented crew observations and descriptions of the lunar
        traverses, and recorded the effects of the interaction between
        Apollo equipment and the lunar surface.
 
      - The Soil Mechanics Experiment studied the properties of the lunar
        soil.
 
      - The Solar Wind Composition Experiment collected samples of the
        solar wind for analysis on Earth.
 
      - The S-Band Transponder Experiment measured the lunar gravitational
        field by observing the dynamical motion of the spacecraft in free
        fall orbits to provide information about the distribution of lunar
        mass.

    Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Spacecraft
    --------------------------------------
    Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter uses a spacecraft design provided by
    Lockheed Martin Space Systems that is smarter, more reliable, more
    agile, and more productive than any previous Mars orbiter. It is
    the first spacecraft designed from the ground up for aerobraking,
    a rigorous phase of the mission where the orbiter uses the
    friction of the martian atmosphere to slow down in order to settle
    into its final orbit around Mars.
 
    When fully assembled and fueled, the spacecraft had to weigh less
    than 2,180 kilograms (4,806 pounds) so that the Atlas V launch
    vehicle could lift it into the proper orbit. All subsystems and
    instruments on board (the so-called 'dry mass') weighed less than
    1,031 kilograms (2,273 pounds) to allow room for 1,149 kilograms
    (2,533 pounds) of propellant for trajectory correction maneuvers
    that kept the spacecraft on target during the cruise to Mars and
    for burns that helped capture the spacecraft into orbit around
    Mars.
 
 
    Spacecraft Configurations
    -------------------------
    During its five-year mission, the spacecraft needed to operate in
    four distinct mission phases.
 
    Launch: During launch, the spacecraft had to fit within the nose
    cone, or payload fairing, of the launch vehicle, so the large
    parts like the high-gain antenna and the solar arrays were
    designed to be folded up. As soon as the launch vehicle placed the
    spacecraft on a course to leave earth orbit for its journey to
    Mars, it disconnected itself from the spacecraft.
 
    Cruise: As soon as the spacecraft was clear of the launch vehicle,
    the orbiter deployed its solar arrays to begin producing power.
    The high-gain antenna was also be deployed at this point. The
    high-gain antenna moved to track the Earth, while the solar panels
    remained fixed.
 
    Mars Orbit Insertion and Aerobraking: The Mars orbit insertion and
    aerobraking configuration looked very much like the cruise
    configuration, except that the high-gain antenna was moved to a
    position that balanced the solar arrays as it flew through the
    upper atmosphere of Mars. The heaviest part of the spacecraft (the
    propellant tank) also made the spacecraft very stable. Due to the
    large area (37.7 square meters or 405.8 square feet) of the
    spacecraft in this configuration, each pass through the martian
    atmosphere during aerobraking caused significant slowing, thus
    reducing the size of the orbit. Friction from the atmosphere had
    the additional effect of heating up the spacecraft, so components
    were designed to withstand this heating. The flight team could
    further control the heating by changing how deeply the spacecraft
    dipped into the atmosphere on each orbit.
 
    Science Operations:  During the primary science phase, the
    orbiter's job was to point its science instruments at Mars to
    collect images and other data from targets on the surface of Mars,
    while ensuring that the high-gain antenna and solar arrays were
    continuously tracking the Earth and the Sun, respectively.
 
    The orbiter typically kept its science instruments pointed to
    nadir (looking straight down at the surface). A few times per day,
    and for about fifteen minutes each time, the orbiter pointed side-
    to-side in order to capture high-priority science targets that did
    not fall directly beneath the spacecraft. The spacecraft could
    point off-nadir up to 30 degrees.
 
 
    Major Spacecraft Components
    ---------------------------
    Science Payload Instruments: To fulfill the mission science
    objectives, seven scientific investigations teams were selected by
    NASA.  Four teams (MARCI, MCS, HiRISE, and CRISM) were led by
    Principal Investigators (PI).  Each PI lead team was responsible
    for the provision and operation of a scientific instrument and the
    analysis of its data. The PI lead investigations were: Mars Color
    Imager (MARCI); Mars Climate Sounder, (MCS); High Resolution
    Imaging Science Experiment, (HiRISE); and Compact Reconnaissance
    Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, (CRISM).
 
    In addition to the PI lead teams, there were two investigation
    teams that made use of facility instruments. The facility
    instruments were Context Imager (CTX) and Shallow (Subsurface)
    Radar (SHARAD).
 
    The MARCI PI and Science Team also acted as Team Leader (TL) and
    Team     Members for the CTX facility instrument.  The Italian
    Space Agency (ASI) provided a second facility instrument, SHARAD,
    for flight on MRO. ASI and NASA both selected members of the
    SHARAD investigation team with ASI appointing the Team Leader and
    NASA appointing the Deputy Team Leader.
 
    In addition to the instrument investigations, Gravity Science and
    Atmospheric Structure Facility Investigation Teams used data from
    the spacecraft telecommunications and accelerometers,
    respectively, to conduct scientific investigations.

      Louis.
 
    Engineering Instruments: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter carried three
    instruments that will assist in spacecraft navigation and
    communications.
 
    1. Electra UHF Communications and Navigation Package: Electra
    allowed the spacecraft to act as a communications relay between
    the Earth and landed crafts on Mars that may not have sufficient
    radio power to communicate directly with Earth by themselves.
 
    2. Optical Navigation Camera: This camera was being tested for
    improved navigation capability for future missions. Similar
    cameras placed on orbiters of the future would be able to serve as
    high-precision interplanetary 'eyes' to guide incoming spacecraft
    as they near Mars.
 
    3. Ka-band Telecommunications Experiment Package: Mars
    Reconnaissance     Orbiter tested the use of a radio frequency
    called Ka-band to demonstrate the potential for greater
    performance in communications using significantly less power.
 
    Structures:  The structures subsystem is the skeleton around which
    the spacecraft was assembled. It supported and protected the other
    engineering subsystems and the science instruments. It was strong
    enough to survive launch, when the forces can exceed 5 g's.
    Extremely lightweight but strong materials were used to achieve
    this strength, including titanium, carbon composites, and aluminum
    honeycomb.
 
    Mechanisms:  There were three main mechanisms on board Mars
    Reconnaissance Orbiter:
 
    * one that allowed the high-gain antenna to move in order to point
      at earth
    * two that allowed the solar arrays to move to point at the sun
 
    Each of these mechanisms, called gimbals, moved about two axes in
    much the same way that your wrist allows your hand to move in two
    axes: left/right and up/down.
 
    As the spacecraft traveled around Mars each orbit, these gimbals
    allowed both solar arrays to be always pointed toward the sun,
    while the high-gain antenna could simultaneously always be pointed
    at earth.
 
    Telecommunications System:  The telecommunications subsystem was a
    two-way radio system used for receiving and transmitting commands
    and data between the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Deep
    Space Network antenna on earth. With its large-dish antenna,
    powerful amplifier, and fast computer, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
    could transmit data to earth at rates as high as 6 megabits per
    second, a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters. The
    orbiter's radio operated in the X-band of the radio spectrum, at a
    frequency of around 8 Gigahertz.
 
    Major components of the telecom subsystem included:
    * Antennas for transmitting and receiving commands
    * Amplifiers for boosting the power of radio signals so that they
      are strong enough to be received at the Deep Space Network
      antennas
    * Transponders for translating navigation and other signals from
      the orbiter
 
    Also on board was Electra, a UHF telecommunications package that
    was one of the engineering instruments providing navigation and
    communications support to landers and rovers on the surface of
    Mars. Electra allowed the spacecraft to act as a relay between the
    earth and landed crafts on Mars, which may not have sufficient
    radio power to communicate directly with earth.
 
    High-gain Antenna: The high-gain antenna is a 3-meter diameter
    (10-foot) dish antenna for sending and receiving data at high
    rates. The high-gain antenna was deployed shortly after launch and
    remained deployed for the remainder of the mission. It served as
    the primary means of communication to and from the orbiter. The
    high-gain antenna had to be pointed accurately and was therefore
    steered using the gimbal mechanism.
 
    Low-gain Antennas: Two smaller antennas were present for lower-
    rate communication during emergencies and special events, such as
    launch and Mars Orbit Insertion. The data rate of these antennas
    was lower because they focused the radio beam much more broadly
    than the high gain antenna, so less of the signal reached earth.
    But the Deep Space Network station on the earth could detect the
    signal even when the spacecraft was not pointed at earth, and
    therefore these antennas were useful for emergencies. The low-gain
    antennas had the capability to transmit and receive. The two low-
    gain antennas were mounted on the high-gain antenna dish--one on
    the front side and one on the back--and were moved with it. Two
    were needed in that placement so that communication was possible
    at all times, no matter what the position of the spacecraft might
    be at a given time.
 
    Amplifiers: Located on the backside of the high-gain antenna was
    the     enclosure for the Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers, which
    boosted the power of radio signals so that they were strong enough
    to be received at the Deep Space Network antennas. There were
    three amplifiers on board:
 
    * two for the X-band radio frequency that transmitted radio
    signals at a power of 100 watts (the second one was for back up
    to ensure communications in case the first amplifier failed)
 
    * one for Ka-band radio frequency that was capable of transmitting
    at 35 watts.
 
    Transponders: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter carried two
    transponders, which are special types of radio
    receiver/transmitters, specially designed for long-range space
    communications. The second transponder was a backup. The
    transponders had several functions:
 
    * transmit/receive function: translated digital electrical signals
    into radio signals for sending data to earth, and translated radio
    signals to digital electrical signals for receiving commands from
    earth
 
    * transponding function: listened for and detected a signal coming
    in from earth, to which it automatically responded
 
    * navigation function: transmitted several types of signals that
    provided     critical navigation clues, enabling navigators on the
    ground to make precise calculations of the spacecraft speed and
    distance from earth
 
    Propulsion: The propulsion subsystem performed major maneuvers
    such as trajectory correction maneuvers and Mars orbit insertion.
    The propulsion subsystem was also used to control the spacecraft's
    position, as a backup to the reaction wheels.
 
    Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter used a monopropellant propulsion
    system: it carried fuel (hydrazine), but no oxidizer. Thrust was
    produced by passing the fuel over beds of catalyst material just
    before it entered the thruster, which caused the hydrazine to
    combust.
 
    The propulsion system included:
 
    Propellant Tank
    The monopropellant hydrazine tank held 1187 kilograms (2617
    pounds) of usable propellant. Over 70% of the total propellant was
    used during Mars orbit insertion.
 
    Pressurant Tank
    Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter fed pressurized helium gas from a
    separate high- pressure tank, through a regulator, into the
    propellant tank where it put the hydrazine propellant under
    pressure.
 
    Lines, Valves, and Regulators
    The pressurized hydrazine flowed through a system of metal tubing
    to each of the thrusters. Each thruster had a valve so that it
    could be fired independently. Additional valves in the propellant
    lines turned on and off the flow to groups of thrusters.
 
    Thrusters
    A total of 20 rocket engine thrusters were onboard:
 
    * Six large thrusters, each producing 170 Newtons* (38 pounds
    force) of thrust for performing the Mars orbit insertion burn.
    Together, all six produce 1,020 Newtons (230 pounds force) of
    thrust.
 
    * Six medium thrusters, each producing 22 Newtons* (5 pounds
    force) of thrust for performing trajectory correction maneuvers,
    and for helping to keep the spacecraft pointing in the right
    direction during the Mars orbit insertion burn.
 
    * Eight small thrusters, each producing 0.9 Newtons* (0.2 pounds
    force) of thrust for controlling where the orbiter is pointed
    during normal operations as well as during Mars orbit insertion
    and trajectory correction maneuvers.
 
    Command and Data-Handling Systems:  The Command and Data Handling
    subsystem controlled all spacecraft functions. This system:
 
    * managed all forms of data on the spacecraft;
    * carried out commands sent from earth;
    * prepared data for transmission to the earth;
    * managed collection of solar power and charging of the batteries;
    * collected and processed information about all subsystems and
      payloads;
    * kept and distributed the spacecraft time;
    * calculated its position in orbit around Mars;
    * carried out commanded maneuvers; and
    * autonomously monitored and responded to any onboard
      problems that occurred.
 
    The key parts of this system were:
 
    * Space Flight Computer (a space-qualified processor based on the
      133 MHz PowerPC processor)
    * Flight Software
    * Solid State Recorder (total capacity 160 Gigabits)
 
    Guidance, Navigation, and Control Systems:  The guidance,
    navigation, and control subsystem was used to control the
    orientation of the orbiter as it travels through space and to
    maintain knowledge of where celestial bodies are located (for
    example, Earth and the sun). This knowledge was critical for the
    spacecraft to perform the correct maneuvers to get to Mars, to
    keep its solar arrays pointed toward the sun in order to produce
    power, and to keep its antenna pointed toward the earth in order
    to maintain communications.
 
    Once in orbit around Mars, this subsystem also maintained constant
    knowledge of where the spacecraft was in its orbit, and was able to
    point the science cameras to an accuracy of about 1/20th of one
    degree.
 
    Electrical Power:  The electrical power subsystem was responsible
    for generating, storing, and distributing power to the orbiter
    systems and included two solar panels and two nickel-hydrogen
    batteries.
 
    Solar panels: The one and only source of power for Mars
    Reconnaissance Orbiter was sunlight. Mounted on opposite sides of
    the orbiter and capable of changing position to allow the orbiter
    to track the sun continuously, each solar panel had an area of
    approximately 10 square meters (107.6 square feet), and contained
    3,744 individual solar cells. The solar cells were able to convert
    more than 26% of the sun's energy directly into electricity. The
    solar panels were deployed soon after launch and remained deployed
    throughout the mission.
 
    During aerobraking the solar panels had a special role to play. As
    the     spacecraft skimmed through the upper layers of the martian
    atmosphere, the large, flat panels acted to slow the spacecraft
    down and reduce the size of its orbit. The solar arrays were
    designed to withstand temperatures of almost 200 Celsius.
 
    Nickel-hydrogen batteries: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter used two
    nickel-hydrogen rechargeable batteries, each with an energy
    storage capacity of 50 ampere-hours (at 32 volts, 1600 watts per
    hour). Only about 40% of the battery capacity was intended to be
    used. The batteries charged during the day side of each two-hour
    orbit around Mars, using electricity produced by the solar cells,
    and provided power during the night side of each orbit.
 
    Thermal Systems: The thermal subsystem maintained the right
    temperatures in all parts of the spacecraft. It employed several
    conduction- and radiation-based techniques for thermal control:
 
    * Radiators
    * Surface coatings
    * Thermal blankets
    * Heaters.]]></field>

  ========================
 
    Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Spacecraft
    --------------------------------------
    Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter uses a spacecraft design provided by
    Lockheed Martin Space Systems that is smarter, more reliable, more
    agile, and more productive than any previous Mars orbiter. It is
    the first spacecraft designed from the ground up for aerobraking,
    a rigorous phase of the mission where the orbiter uses the
    friction of the martian atmosphere to slow down in order to settle
    into its final orbit around Mars.
 
    When fully assembled and fueled, the spacecraft had to weigh less
    than 2,180 kilograms (4,806 pounds) so that the Atlas V launch
    vehicle could lift it into the proper orbit. All subsystems and
    instruments on board (the so-called 'dry mass') weighed less than
    1,031 kilograms (2,273 pounds) to allow room for 1,149 kilograms
    (2,533 pounds) of propellant for trajectory correction maneuvers
    that kept the spacecraft on target during the cruise to Mars and
    for burns that helped capture the spacecraft into orbit around
    Mars.
 
 
    Spacecraft Configurations
    -------------------------
    During its five-year mission, the spacecraft needed to operate in
    four distinct mission phases.
 
    Launch: During launch, the spacecraft had to fit within the nose
    cone, or payload fairing, of the launch vehicle, so the large
    parts like the high-gain antenna and the solar arrays were
    designed to be folded up. As soon as the launch vehicle placed the
    spacecraft on a course to leave earth orbit for its journey to
    Mars, it disconnected itself from the spacecraft.
 
    Cruise: As soon as the spacecraft was clear of the launch vehicle,
    the orbiter deployed its solar arrays to begin producing power.
    The high-gain antenna was also be deployed at this point. The
    high-gain antenna moved to track the Earth, while the solar panels
    remained fixed.
 
    Mars Orbit Insertion and Aerobraking: The Mars orbit insertion and
    aerobraking configuration looked very much like the cruise
    configuration, except that the high-gain antenna was moved to a
    position that balanced the solar arrays as it flew through the
    upper atmosphere of Mars. The heaviest part of the spacecraft (the
    propellant tank) also made the spacecraft very stable. Due to the
    large area (37.7 square meters or 405.8 square feet) of the
    spacecraft in this configuration, each pass through the martian
    atmosphere during aerobraking caused significant slowing, thus
    reducing the size of the orbit. Friction from the atmosphere had
    the additional effect of heating up the spacecraft, so components
    were designed to withstand this heating. The flight team could
    further control the heating by changing how deeply the spacecraft
    dipped into the atmosphere on each orbit.
 
    Science Operations:  During the primary science phase, the
    orbiter's job was to point its science instruments at Mars to
    collect images and other data from targets on the surface of Mars,
    while ensuring that the high-gain antenna and solar arrays were
    continuously tracking the Earth and the Sun, respectively.
 
    The orbiter typically kept its science instruments pointed to
    nadir (looking straight down at the surface). A few times per day,
    and for about fifteen minutes each time, the orbiter pointed side-
    to-side in order to capture high-priority science targets that did
    not fall directly beneath the spacecraft. The spacecraft could
    point off-nadir up to 30 degrees.
 
 
    Major Spacecraft Components
    ---------------------------
    Science Payload Instruments: To fulfill the mission science
    objectives, seven scientific investigations teams were selected by
    NASA.  Four teams (MARCI, MCS, HiRISE, and CRISM) were led by
    Principal Investigators (PI).  Each PI lead team was responsible
    for the provision and operation of a scientific instrument and the
    analysis of its data. The PI lead investigations were: Mars Color
    Imager (MARCI); Mars Climate Sounder, (MCS); High Resolution
    Imaging Science Experiment, (HiRISE); and Compact Reconnaissance
    Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, (CRISM).
 
    In addition to the PI lead teams, there were two investigation
    teams that made use of facility instruments. The facility
    instruments were Context Imager (CTX) and Shallow (Subsurface)
    Radar (SHARAD).
 
    The MARCI PI and Science Team also acted as Team Leader (TL) and
    Team     Members for the CTX facility instrument.  The Italian
    Space Agency (ASI) provided a second facility instrument, SHARAD,
    for flight on MRO. ASI and NASA both selected members of the
    SHARAD investigation team with ASI appointing the Team Leader and
    NASA appointing the Deputy Team Leader.
 
    In addition to the instrument investigations, Gravity Science and
    Atmospheric Structure Facility Investigation Teams used data from
    the spacecraft telecommunications and accelerometers,
    respectively, to conduct scientific investigations.

    Engineering Instruments: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter carried three
    instruments that will assist in spacecraft navigation and
    communications.
 
    1. Electra UHF Communications and Navigation Package: Electra
    allowed the spacecraft to act as a communications relay between
    the Earth and landed crafts on Mars that may not have sufficient
    radio power to communicate directly with Earth by themselves.
 
    2. Optical Navigation Camera: This camera was being tested for
    improved navigation capability for future missions. Similar
    cameras placed on orbiters of the future would be able to serve as
    high-precision interplanetary 'eyes' to guide incoming spacecraft
    as they near Mars.
 
    3. Ka-band Telecommunications Experiment Package: Mars
    Reconnaissance     Orbiter tested the use of a radio frequency
    called Ka-band to demonstrate the potential for greater
    performance in communications using significantly less power.
 
    Structures:  The structures subsystem is the skeleton around which
    the spacecraft was assembled. It supported and protected the other
    engineering subsystems and the science instruments. It was strong
    enough to survive launch, when the forces can exceed 5 g's.
    Extremely lightweight but strong materials were used to achieve
    this strength, including titanium, carbon composites, and aluminum
    honeycomb.
 
    Mechanisms:  There were three main mechanisms on board Mars
    Reconnaissance Orbiter:
 
    * one that allowed the high-gain antenna to move in order to point
      at earth
    * two that allowed the solar arrays to move to point at the sun
 
    Each of these mechanisms, called gimbals, moved about two axes in
    much the same way that your wrist allows your hand to move in two
    axes: left/right and up/down.
 
    As the spacecraft traveled around Mars each orbit, these gimbals
    allowed both solar arrays to be always pointed toward the sun,
    while the high-gain antenna could simultaneously always be pointed
    at earth.
 
    Telecommunications System:  The telecommunications subsystem was a
    two-way radio system used for receiving and transmitting commands
    and data between the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Deep
    Space Network antenna on earth. With its large-dish antenna,
    powerful amplifier, and fast computer, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
    could transmit data to earth at rates as high as 6 megabits per
    second, a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters. The
    orbiter's radio operated in the X-band of the radio spectrum, at a
    frequency of around 8 Gigahertz.
 
    Major components of the telecom subsystem included:
    * Antennas for transmitting and receiving commands
    * Amplifiers for boosting the power of radio signals so that they
      are strong enough to be received at the Deep Space Network
      antennas
    * Transponders for translating navigation and other signals from
      the orbiter
 
    Also on board was Electra, a UHF telecommunications package that
    was one of the engineering instruments providing navigation and
    communications support to landers and rovers on the surface of
    Mars. Electra allowed the spacecraft to act as a relay between the
    earth and landed crafts on Mars, which may not have sufficient
    radio power to communicate directly with earth.
 
    High-gain Antenna: The high-gain antenna is a 3-meter diameter
    (10-foot) dish antenna for sending and receiving data at high
    rates. The high-gain antenna was deployed shortly after launch and
    remained deployed for the remainder of the mission. It served as
    the primary means of communication to and from the orbiter. The
    high-gain antenna had to be pointed accurately and was therefore
    steered using the gimbal mechanism.
 
    Low-gain Antennas: Two smaller antennas were present for lower-
    rate communication during emergencies and special events, such as
    launch and Mars Orbit Insertion. The data rate of these antennas
    was lower because they focused the radio beam much more broadly
    than the high gain antenna, so less of the signal reached earth.
    But the Deep Space Network station on the earth could detect the
    signal even when the spacecraft was not pointed at earth, and
    therefore these antennas were useful for emergencies. The low-gain
    antennas had the capability to transmit and receive. The two low-
    gain antennas were mounted on the high-gain antenna dish--one on
    the front side and one on the back--and were moved with it. Two
    were needed in that placement so that communication was possible
    at all times, no matter what the position of the spacecraft might
    be at a given time.
 
    Amplifiers: Located on the backside of the high-gain antenna was
    the     enclosure for the Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers, which
    boosted the power of radio signals so that they were strong enough
    to be received at the Deep Space Network antennas. There were
    three amplifiers on board:
 
    * two for the X-band radio frequency that transmitted radio
    signals at a power of 100 watts (the second one was for back up
    to ensure communications in case the first amplifier failed)
 
    * one for Ka-band radio frequency that was capable of transmitting
    at 35 watts.
 
    Transponders: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter carried two
    transponders, which are special types of radio
    receiver/transmitters, specially designed for long-range space
    communications. The second transponder was a backup. The
    transponders had several functions:
 
    * transmit/receive function: translated digital electrical signals
    into radio signals for sending data to earth, and translated radio
    signals to digital electrical signals for receiving commands from
    earth

    * navigation function: transmitted several types of signals that
    provided     critical navigation clues, enabling navigators on the
    ground to make precise calculations of the spacecraft speed and
    distance from earth
 
    Propulsion: The propulsion subsystem performed major maneuvers
    such as trajectory correction maneuvers and Mars orbit insertion.
    The propulsion subsystem was also used to control the spacecraft's
    position, as a backup to the reaction wheels.
 
    Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter used a monopropellant propulsion
    system: it carried fuel (hydrazine), but no oxidizer. Thrust was
    produced by passing the fuel over beds of catalyst material just
    before it entered the thruster, which caused the hydrazine to
    combust.
 
    The propulsion system included:
 
    Propellant Tank
    The monopropellant hydrazine tank held 1187 kilograms (2617
    pounds) of usable propellant. Over 70% of the total propellant was
    used during Mars orbit insertion.
 
    Pressurant Tank
    Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter fed pressurized helium gas from a
    separate high- pressure tank, through a regulator, into the
    propellant tank where it put the hydrazine propellant under
    pressure.
 
    Lines, Valves, and Regulators
    The pressurized hydrazine flowed through a system of metal tubing
    to each of the thrusters. Each thruster had a valve so that it
    could be fired independently. Additional valves in the propellant
    lines turned on and off the flow to groups of thrusters.
 
    Thrusters
    A total of 20 rocket engine thrusters were onboard:
 
    * Six large thrusters, each producing 170 Newtons* (38 pounds
    force) of thrust for performing the Mars orbit insertion burn.
    Together, all six produce 1,020 Newtons (230 pounds force) of
    thrust.
 
    * Six medium thrusters, each producing 22 Newtons* (5 pounds
    force) of thrust for performing trajectory correction maneuvers,
    and for helping to keep the spacecraft pointing in the right
    direction during the Mars orbit insertion burn.
 
    * Eight small thrusters, each producing 0.9 Newtons* (0.2 pounds
    force) of thrust for controlling where the orbiter is pointed
    during normal operations as well as during Mars orbit insertion
    and trajectory correction maneuvers.
 
    Command and Data-Handling Systems:  The Command and Data Handling
    subsystem controlled all spacecraft functions. This system:
 
    * managed all forms of data on the spacecraft;
    * carried out commands sent from earth;
    * prepared data for transmission to the earth;
    * managed collection of solar power and charging of the batteries;
    * collected and processed information about all subsystems and
      payloads;
    * kept and distributed the spacecraft time;
    * calculated its position in orbit around Mars;
    * carried out commanded maneuvers; and
    * autonomously monitored and responded to any onboard
      problems that occurred.
 
    The key parts of this system were:
 
    * Space Flight Computer (a space-qualified processor based on the
      133 MHz PowerPC processor)
    * Flight Software
    * Solid State Recorder (total capacity 160 Gigabits)
 
    Guidance, Navigation, and Control Systems:  The guidance,
    navigation, and control subsystem was used to control the
    orientation of the orbiter as it travels through space and to
    maintain knowledge of where celestial bodies are located (for
    example, Earth and the sun). This knowledge was critical for the
    spacecraft to perform the correct maneuvers to get to Mars, to
    keep its solar arrays pointed toward the sun in order to produce
    power, and to keep its antenna pointed toward the earth in order
    to maintain communications.
 
    Once in orbit around Mars, this subsystem also maintained constant
    knowledge of where the spacecraft was in its orbit, and was able to
    point the science cameras to an accuracy of about 1/20th of one
    degree.
 
    Electrical Power:  The electrical power subsystem was responsible
    for generating, storing, and distributing power to the orbiter
    systems and included two solar panels and two nickel-hydrogen
    batteries.
 
    Solar panels: The one and only source of power for Mars
    Reconnaissance Orbiter was sunlight. Mounted on opposite sides of
    the orbiter and capable of changing position to allow the orbiter
    to track the sun continuously, each solar panel had an area of
    approximately 10 square meters (107.6 square feet), and contained
    3,744 individual solar cells. The solar cells were able to convert
    more than 26% of the sun's energy directly into electricity. The
    solar panels were deployed soon after launch and remained deployed
    throughout the mission.
 
    During aerobraking the solar panels had a special role to play. As
    the     spacecraft skimmed through the upper layers of the martian
    atmosphere, the large, flat panels acted to slow the spacecraft
    down and reduce the size of its orbit. The solar arrays were
    designed to withstand temperatures of almost 200 Celsius.
 
    Nickel-hydrogen batteries: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter used two
    nickel-hydrogen rechargeable batteries, each with an energy
    storage capacity of 50 ampere-hours (at 32 volts, 1600 watts per
    hour). Only about 40% of the battery capacity was intended to be
    used. The batteries charged during the day side of each two-hour
    orbit around Mars, using electricity produced by the solar cells,
    and provided power during the night side of each orbit.
 
    Thermal Systems: The thermal subsystem maintained the right
    temperatures in all parts of the spacecraft. It employed several
    conduction- and radiation-based techniques for thermal control:
 
    * Radiators
    * Surface coatings
    * Thermal blankets
    * Heaters.]]></field>

  Bodies in the Kuiper Belt, 2004 [STERN&SPENCER2004A]
 
- The New Horizons web page originally at
  http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/
 
 
  Overview
  ========
    The New Horizons spacecraft observatory includes propulsion,
    navigation, and communications systems, plus the payload. The
    spacecraft is roughly 2.5 meters across and its mass is 465 kg
    including propellant. Design features include 64 Gbits of redundant
    solid-state data storage, a 290 m/s propulsion budget, and the
    capability to transmit data from 32 AU at almost 1 kilobit/second.
 
    The instrument payload [Stern & Cheng, 2002, STERN&CHENG2002]
    comprises the two-sensor RALPH Vis-IR remote sensing package, the
    ALICE UV imaging spectrometer, the REX radio/radiometry experiment,
    the two-sensor PEPPSI/SWAP plasma suite, the LORRI long-focal-length
    imager, and the SDC student-built dust counter.
 
 
  Payload
  =======
    The New Horizons team selected instruments that not only directly
    measure NASA-provided items of interest (NASA AO 01-OSS-01, 2001,
    [NASAAO2001]), but also provide backup to other instruments on the
    spacecraft should one fail during the mission.
 
    The payload comprises seven instruments:
 
 
    RALPH
    -----
      The main objectives for the RALPH instrument are to obtain high
      resolution color maps and surface composition maps of the surfaces
      of Pluto and Charon. The instrument has two separate channels: the
      Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) and the Linear Etalon
      Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA). A single telescope with a 3-inch
      (6-centimeter) aperture collects and focuses the light used in both
      channels.
 
      RALPH/MVIC operates at visible wavelengths and has 4 different
      filters for producing color maps. One filter allows measurement of
      the methane frost distribution over the surface, while the others
      are more generic and cover blue, red and near-infrared colors,
      respectively. MVIC also has two panchromatic filters that pass
      essentially all visible light.  This will be useful for low-light
      level observations requiring  maximum sensitivity.  In all cases,
      the light passes from the telescope through the filters and is
      focused onto a charge coupled device (CCD).
 
      RALPH/LEISA operates at infrared wavelengths, and its etalon acts
      like a prism to bend different wavelengths of light by different
      amounts so that each wavelength can be analyzed separately. LEISA
      maps the distribution of frosts of methane (CH4), molecular nitrogen
      (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), and water (H2O) over the surface of
      Pluto and the water frost distribution over the surface of Charon.
      LEISA data may also reveal new constituents on the surfaces that
      have never before been detected.
 
 
    ALICE
    -----
      Alice is an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer that probes the
      atmospheric composition of Pluto.
 
      Alice has two modes of operation: an airglow mode, which measures
      emissions from atmospheric constituents, and an occultation mode,
      which views either the Sun or a bright star through the atmosphere
      producing absorption by the atmospheric constituents. The Alice
      occultation mode occurs just after New Horizons passes behind Pluto
      and looks back at the Sun through the Pluto atmosphere.
 
 
    REX
    ---
      REX is an acronym for Radio EXperiment. It is integrated into the
      New Horizons radio telecommunications system.
 
      Using an occultation technique similar to that described above for
      the Alice instrument, REX probes the Pluto atmosphere. After New
      Horizons flies by Pluto, its 2.1 meter radio antenna points back at
      Earth. On Earth, powerful radio transmitters in the NASA Deep Space
      Network (DSN) point at New Horizons and send radio signals to the
      spacecraft. As the spacecraft passes behind Pluto, the atmosphere
      bends the radio waves by an amount that depends on the average
      molecular weight of the gas in the atmosphere and the atmospheric
      temperature. REX records the detected radio waves and sends the data
      back to Earth for analysis.
 
      REX also has a radiometry mode, which measures the weak radio
      thermal emission from Pluto itself. When REX looks back at Pluto
      following the flyby, radiometry data are taken to derive a value for
      the Pluto nightside temperature.
 
 
    LORRI
    -----
      The instrument that provides the highest spatial resolution on New
      Horizons is LORRI - short for Long Range Reconnaissance Imager -
      which comprises a telescope with a 20.8cm aperture that focuses
      visible light onto a charge coupled device (CCD). LORRI has a very
      simple design; there are no filters or moving parts. Near the time
      of closest approach, LORRI takes images of the Pluto surface at 100m
      resolution.
 
 
    SWAP
    ----
      The Solar Wind Analyzer around Pluto (SWAP) instrument measures
      charged particles from the solar wind near Pluto to determine
      whether Pluto has a magnetosphere and how fast the atmosphere is
      escaping.
 
 
    PEPSSI
    ------
      Another plasma-sensing instrument, the Pluto Energetic Particle
      Spectrometer Investigation (PEPSSI), searches for neutral atoms that
      escape the Pluto atmosphere and subsequently become charged by their
      interaction with the solar wind.
 
 
    SDC
    ---
      The Student Dust Counter, which was later re-named The Venetia
      Burney Student Dust Counter (VSDC), is an Education and Public
      Outreach project.  VSDC measures the dust density of the
      Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDP) by measuring the charge
      generated in the VSDC sensor from dust impact events.  From this may
      be inferred the size and distribution of dust particles along the
      entire New Horizons trajectory, including regions of interplanetary
      space never before sampled.  Such dust particles are created by
      comets shedding material and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) colliding
      with other KBOs.  The VSDC is managed and was built primarily by
      students at the University of Colorado in Boulder, with supervision
      from professional space scientists.
 
 
  Communications
  ==============
    The New Horizons mission operations team communicates with the
    spacecraft through DSN of antenna stations. The DSN consists of
    facilities in the Mojave Desert in California; near Madrid, Spain; and
    near Canberra, Australia.
 
 
  Power
  =====
    Electrical power for the New Horizons spacecraft and science
    instruments is provided by a single radioisotope thermoelectric
    generator, or RTG, supplied by the Department of Energy.  The New
    Horizons trajectory takes it more than 4 billion miles from Earth,
    where light from the Sun is 1,000 times fainter than at Earth.  An RTG
    is used on missions, such as New Horizons, that can not use solar
    power - yet require a proven, reliable power supply that can produce
    up to several kilowatts of power and operate under severe
    environmental conditions for many years.
 
    Carrying out the New Horizons mission safely is a top priority at
    NASA. As part of that focus, NASA informed the public about use by New
    Horizons of an RTG by publishing a detailed Environmental Impact
    Statement - or EIS - and several fact sheets. The Final EIS, which
    includes public comments on the Draft EIS and the NASA responses to
    those comments, was released in July 2005.]]></field>

<field name="instrument_host_description"><![CDATA[Instrument Host Overview
  ========================
    Lunar Prospector (LP) is a small, simple, spin-stabilized spacecraft
    with minimal operational requirements [BINDERETAL1998].  Its fueled
    mass is 305 kg.  The spacecraft bus is a graphite-epoxy drum that is
    1.37 m in diameter and 1.28 m tall.  Power is provided by solar
    cells mounted on the surface of the bus assembly, which produce an
    average of 186 w.  There is also a rechargeable, 4.8 amp-hr NiCd
    battery for power during night side passes.  The science instruments
    are mounted on three 2.5 m booms.  The Gamma Ray Spectrometer is
    mounted on one boom, the Neutron Spectrometer and Alpha Particle
    Spectrometers are mounted on another boom, and the Magnetometer and
    Electron Reflectometer are mounted on the third boom.  The
    Magnetometer instrument is mounted on a 1.2 m long boom extending
    beyond the main boom to isolate it from the Electron Reflectometer.
 
    The spacecraft bus houses three fuel tanks, six engines, and five
    electronic units.  The fuel tanks at launch hold 138 kg of hydrazine
    pressurized with helium.  There are two aft axial engines, two
    forward axial engines, and two tangential engines.
 
    The communication system consists of an S-band transponder, an omni
    antenna with 3-pi steradian antenna pattern for uplink and downlink,
    and a medium gain antenna for downlink.  The engineering-only
    downlink data rate is 300 bps and the science/engineering downlink
    data rate is 3600 bps.
 
    Command and control of the spacecraft is achieved by a simple
    Command and Data Handling (C&DH) unit.  As an individual command is
    uplinked to the spacecraft, the C&DH directs the command to the
    appropriate subsystem.  All science and engineering data are
    collected by the C&DH and then are buffered and formatted for
    downlink by the C&DH.  The data are downlinked at 1800 bps
    immediately and simultaneously dumped into a solid state recorder.
    The data stored on the solid state recorder is downlinked 53 minutes
    later.  These delayed data frames are interleaved into the real-time
    data stream, yielding a total downlink rate of 3600 bps.  The
    purpose of the delayed stream is to receive data acquired during
    communications blackout periods and to eliminate the need for a
    commandable data recorder.
 
    The LP spacecraft clock or frame counter increments once every 2
    seconds.  It is stored in a 24-bit register.  This means that the
    clock will reset after about 33.5 million seconds or about once per
    year.  The clock reset on January 30, 1999 at about 12:09 UTC, which
    was early in the Extended Mission.
 
 
  Spacecraft Coordinate System
  ============================
    The Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) stage and spacecraft body
    coordinate system is discussed below.  The origin of
    coordinates is: a) in the separation plane between the
    spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage; and b) at the

  Instrument Host Overview - DSN
  ==============================
    The Deep Space Network (DSN) is a telecommunications facility
    managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute
    of Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration (NASA).
 
    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way communications
    between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar system.  To
    carry out this function it is equipped with high-power transmitters,
    low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and
    control systems.
 
    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately
    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone
    (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and
    Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes are
    located in the northern hemisphere while the third is in the
    southern hemisphere.
 
    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their diameters,
    construction, or operational characteristics: 70-m diameter,
    standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter (HEF), and
    34-m beam waveguide (BWG).  These DSN complexes, in conjunction with
    telecommunications subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft,
    constitute the major elements of instrumentation for radio science
    investigations.

  Science Packages
  ================
    The Lunar Prospector spacecraft has five science instruments.  The
    instruments are a Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), a Neutron
    Spectrometer (NS), an Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS), a
    Magnetometer (MAG), and an Electron Reflectometer (ER).  A Doppler
    Gravity Experiment (DGE) uses Doppler tracking data for deriving
    gravity measurements.  In addition, the spacecraft spin rate and
    attitude are determined on the ground from data derived from a sun
    sensor and an IR Earth/Moon limb crossing sensor.]]></field>

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Instrument Host Overview
  ========================
    Lunar Prospector (LP) is a small, simple, spin-stabilized spacecraft
    with minimal operational requirements [BINDERETAL1998].  Its fueled
    mass is 305 kg.  The spacecraft bus is a graphite-epoxy drum that is
    1.37 m in diameter and 1.28 m tall.  Power is provided by solar
    cells mounted on the surface of the bus assembly, which produce an
    average of 186 w.  There is also a rechargeable, 4.8 amp-hr NiCd
    battery for power during night side passes.  The science instruments
    are mounted on three 2.5 m booms.  The Gamma Ray Spectrometer is
    mounted on one boom, the Neutron Spectrometer and Alpha Particle
    Spectrometers are mounted on another boom, and the Magnetometer and
    Electron Reflectometer are mounted on the third boom.  The
    Magnetometer instrument is mounted on a 1.2 m long boom extending
    beyond the main boom to isolate it from the Electron Reflectometer.
 
    The spacecraft bus houses three fuel tanks, six engines, and five
    electronic units.  The fuel tanks at launch hold 138 kg of hydrazine
    pressurized with helium.  There are two aft axial engines, two
    forward axial engines, and two tangential engines.
 
    The communication system consists of an S-band transponder, an omni
    antenna with 3-pi steradian antenna pattern for uplink and downlink,
    and a medium gain antenna for downlink.  The engineering-only
    downlink data rate is 300 bps and the science/engineering downlink
    data rate is 3600 bps.
 
    Command and control of the spacecraft is achieved by a simple
    Command and Data Handling (C&DH) unit.  As an individual command is
    uplinked to the spacecraft, the C&DH directs the command to the
    appropriate subsystem.  All science and engineering data are
    collected by the C&DH and then are buffered and formatted for
    downlink by the C&DH.  The data are downlinked at 1800 bps
    immediately and simultaneously dumped into a solid state recorder.
    The data stored on the solid state recorder is downlinked 53 minutes
    later.  These delayed data frames are interleaved into the real-time
    data stream, yielding a total downlink rate of 3600 bps.  The
    purpose of the delayed stream is to receive data acquired during
    communications blackout periods and to eliminate the need for a
    commandable data recorder.
 
    The LP spacecraft clock or frame counter increments once every 2
    seconds.  It is stored in a 24-bit register.  This means that the
    clock will reset after about 33.5 million seconds or about once per
    year.  The clock reset on January 30, 1999 at about 12:09 UTC, which
    was early in the Extended Mission.
 
 
  Spacecraft Coordinate System
  ============================
    The Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) stage and spacecraft body
    coordinate system is discussed below.  The origin of
    coordinates is: a) in the separation plane between the
    spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage; and b) at the
    geometric center of the equilateral triangle defined by the
    bolt holes for the separation nuts.
 
    The Z axis is normal to the separation plane.  The +Z direction
    is towards the medium gain antenna (forward) end of the
    spacecraft.  The X axis is in the separation plane between the
    spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage.  The -X direction
    is parallel to the centerline of instrument boom No.  1 and
    towards the Gamma Ray Spectrometer.  The Y axis is defined by
    the right-hand rule.

    ========================
      For most Magellan experiments, data were collected by
      instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed
      via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space
      Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science experiments (such
      as radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also
      participate in data acquisition.  The following sections
      provide an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the
      DSN ground system as both supported Magellan science
      activities.
 
 
    Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft
    =====================================
      The Magellan spacecraft was built by the Martin Marietta
      Corporation.  The spacecraft structure included four major
      sections: High-Gain Antenna (HGA), Forward Equipment Module
      (FEM), Spacecraft Bus (including the solar array), and the Orbit
      Insertion Stage.  Spacecraft subsystems included those for
      thermal control, power, attitude control, propulsion, command
      data and data storage, and telecommunications.
 
      Design of the Magellan spacecraft was driven by the need for a
      low-cost, high-performance vehicle.  Protoflight units that had
      been built for preflight tests or were spares from the Voyager
      spacecraft were available from storage at no cost.  These
      included the 3.7 meter diameter high-gain antenna (HGA), the
      spacecraft bus, propulsion system components, thermal control
      louvers, and much of the radio subsystem.  The stockpile of
      flight spares for the Galileo spacecraft provided Magellan's
      command and data system, tape recorders, attitude control
      processor, power subsystem and propulsion components.  Further
      elements were drawn from other projects and from NASA standard
      designs.  Only about 30% (by mass) of the Magellan spacecraft --
      primarily the radar electronics and the solar panels -- was
      especially designed for the mission.
 
      The high-gain antenna (HGA) was used as the antenna for the
      synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and as the primary antenna for
      the telecommunications system.  The HGA boresight was defined to
      be the +Z axis for the spacecraft-fixed coordinate system.
 
      The spacecraft bus was a ten sided structure containing the star
      scanner, medium-gain antenna (MGA), rocket engine modules
      (REMs), command data and data storage (CDDS) subsystem, attitude
      control monopropellant tank, and a nitrogen tank for providing
      propellant pressurization.  The solar panel array was attached
      to the bus; its rotation axis defined the +X axis for the
      spacecraft-fixed coordinate system.  The +Y axis of the
      coordinate system was in the nominal direction of the star
      scanner boresight, forming a right-hand coordinate system.
 
      The radar electronics, the reaction wheels, and various other
      spacecraft subsystem components were contained within the
      Forward Equipment Module, located between the bus and HGA.
 
      The orbit insertion stage contained a STAR-48 solid rocket motor
      (SRM) that was used to provide the impulse required to perform
      the Venus Orbit Insertion (VOI) maneuver.
 
      Thermal control of the spacecraft was accomplished by a
      combination of louvers, thermal blankets, passive coatings, and
      heat dissipating elements.  The nominal operating temperature
      for the spacecraft components was between -5 and +40 degrees
      Celsius.  The thermal control subsystem maintained these
      components at the appropriate temperatures for all orientations
      of the spacecraft orbit and sun-line and for all spacecraft
      operating modes.  Electrical power was supplied by two large
      solar panels with a total area of 12.6 square meters.  This
      array was capable of producing a minimum power of 1029 W at the
      end of the nominal mission; it could rotate about its axis to
      allow tracking of the Sun despite the changing
      Earth-Sun-spacecraft geometry during the mission.  A dedicated
      sun sensor optimized power production.  Bus voltage regulation
      was controlled by the power control unit (PCU) with a shunt
      regulator for diverting excess power from the solar arrays to
      maintain power as raw power (28-35 v), regulated power at 28 vDC
      +/-0.56 vDC, and as AC at 2.4 kHz through an inverter.  Two 30
      amp-hour, 26-cell nickel cadmium batteries provided power during
      times of solar occultation and allowed normal spacecraft
      operations independent of real-time solar illumination.  These
      batteries were sized to allow a degraded mission in the event
      that one of them failed.
 
      The attitude of the Magellan spacecraft was controlled through
      the use of reaction wheels, with monopropellant rocket motors
      being used to desaturate the reaction wheels periodically.
      During both the interplanetary cruise and the orbital portions
      of the mission, attitude reference was provided by an inertial
      reference unit (IRU), updated each orbit using celestial
      references.  During the mapping part of each orbit, the
      spacecraft was initially oriented with the HGA pointing down
      toward Venus, with the exact attitude being a function of the
      spacecraft altitude and the SAR mapping objectives.  During the
      downlink transmission part of the orbit, the spacecraft was
      oriented with the HGA slightly off the Earth-line.  The low gain
      antenna (LGA) was mounted coaxially with the HGA and did not
      require pointing since it had an omnidirectional beam pattern.
      The altimeter horn (ALTA) was mounted so that a portion of the
      fan-shaped beam nominally pointed in the nadir direction during
      the mapping part of an orbit.
 
      The Magellan propulsion subsystem consisted of two parts.  The
      first, a Star 48 SRM, provided the impulse for VOI.  Following
      that maneuver, the empty casing and parts of its support
      structure were ejected from the spacecraft.  The second part
      consisted of monopropellant hydrazine thrusters that were used
      for trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) during inter-
      planetary cruise, thrust vector control (TVC) during VOI, orbit
      trim maneuvers during the mapping mission, and attitude control
      when the reaction wheels were being desaturated.  The rocket
      motors were clustered in modules located on the end of outrigger
      booms in order to increase their moment arms and thus decrease
      attitude control propellant requirements.
 
      Twelve 0.9-N (Newton) and four 22-N rocket motors were used for
      attitude control, with thrust being provided by eight 445-N
      rocket motors or by the 0.9-N motors for small TCMs.  All
      engines pointed in the -Z direction, with the exception of the
      roll motors.
 
      The 0.9-N motors were used for tip-off control following
      separation of the inertial upper stage (IUS), reaction wheel
      desaturation, roll control for all times other than VOI, to back
      up any failed reaction wheels, and for small TCMs or orbit trim
      maneuvers (OTMs).  The 22-N motors were used for roll control
      during VOI.  The 445-N motors were used for controlling the
      spacecraft rotational axis during VOI, and to provide impulses
      during all propulsive maneuvers.  The monopropellant motors also
      provided the impulses needed to trim the VOI maneuver.
 
      The command, data and data storage (CDDS) system received uplink
      commands via the radio frequency subsystem (RFS) and controlled
      the spacecraft in response to those commands.  It also
      controlled the acquisition and storage of scientific data and
      sending that data, along with supplemental engineering data, to
      the RFS for downlink transmission to Earth.  The commands were
      sent to the spacecraft as time-event pairs for storage and later
      execution, and also in the form of blocks which the CDDS later
      expanded into spacecraft executable commands.  In the Venus
      orbit phase, commands for up to three days of radar operation
      were stored.  There was also a provision for receiving and
      executing discrete commands sent from the ground.  SAR data were
      stored on two multi-track digital tape records (DTRs) for later
      playback over the high-rate X-band link; there was no provision
      for real-time transmission of the SAR data.  Data storage
      capacity of the two DTRs was approximately 1.8 billion bits.
      Engineering data were normally transmitted to Earth over a
      real-time S-band link.  During those times when a real-time link
      was not possible, the engineering data were recorded on a DTR
      and played back via the X-band high-rate link with the SAR data.
      The recorded data stream was alternately switched between the
      two DTRs so that the data would not be lost during the DTR track
      change.
 
      The Magellan telecommunications subsystem contained all the
      hardware necessary to maintain communications between Earth and
      the spacecraft.  The subsystem contained the radio frequency
      subsystem, the LGA, MGA, and HGA.  The RFS performed the
      functions of carrier transponding, command detection and
      decoding, and telemetry modulation.  The spacecraft was capable
      of simultaneous X-band and S-band uplink and downlink
      operations.  The S-band operated at a transmitter power of 5 W,
      while the X-band operated at a power of 22 W.  Uplink data rates
      were 31.25 and 62.5 bps (bits per second) with downlink data
      rates of 40 bps (emergency only), 1200 bps (real-time
      engineering rate), 115.2 kbps (kilobits per second) (radar
      downlink backup), and 268.8 kbps (nominal).

    Instrument Host Overview - DSN
    ==============================
      The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed
      by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of
      Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration.
 
      The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way
      communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the
      solar system.  To carry out this function it is equipped with
      high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and
      appropriate monitoring and control systems.
 
      The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately
      equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at
      Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,
      Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the
      complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the third
      is in the southern hemisphere.
 
      The network comprises four subnets, each of which includes one
      antenna at each complex.  The four subnets are defined according
      to the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter,
      standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m
      diameter.
 
      These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications
      subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constitute the major
      elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.

    ========================
      For most Magellan experiments, data were collected by
      instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed
      via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space
      Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science experiments (such
      as radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also
      participate in data acquisition.  The following sections
      provide an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the
      DSN ground system as both supported Magellan science
      activities.
 
 
    Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft
    =====================================
      The Magellan spacecraft was built by the Martin Marietta
      Corporation.  The spacecraft structure included four major
      sections: High-Gain Antenna (HGA), Forward Equipment Module
      (FEM), Spacecraft Bus (including the solar array), and the Orbit
      Insertion Stage.  Spacecraft subsystems included those for
      thermal control, power, attitude control, propulsion, command
      data and data storage, and telecommunications.
 
      Design of the Magellan spacecraft was driven by the need for a
      low-cost, high-performance vehicle.  Protoflight units that had
      been built for preflight tests or were spares from the Voyager
      spacecraft were available from storage at no cost.  These
      included the 3.7 meter diameter high-gain antenna (HGA), the
      spacecraft bus, propulsion system components, thermal control
      louvers, and much of the radio subsystem.  The stockpile of
      flight spares for the Galileo spacecraft provided Magellan's
      command and data system, tape recorders, attitude control
      processor, power subsystem and propulsion components.  Further
      elements were drawn from other projects and from NASA standard
      designs.  Only about 30% (by mass) of the Magellan spacecraft --
      primarily the radar electronics and the solar panels -- was
      especially designed for the mission.
 
      The high-gain antenna (HGA) was used as the antenna for the
      synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and as the primary antenna for
      the telecommunications system.  The HGA boresight was defined to
      be the +Z axis for the spacecraft-fixed coordinate system.
 
      The spacecraft bus was a ten sided structure containing the star
      scanner, medium-gain antenna (MGA), rocket engine modules
      (REMs), command data and data storage (CDDS) subsystem, attitude
      control monopropellant tank, and a nitrogen tank for providing
      propellant pressurization.  The solar panel array was attached
      to the bus; its rotation axis defined the +X axis for the
      spacecraft-fixed coordinate system.  The +Y axis of the
      coordinate system was in the nominal direction of the star
      scanner boresight, forming a right-hand coordinate system.
 
      The radar electronics, the reaction wheels, and various other
      spacecraft subsystem components were contained within the
      Forward Equipment Module, located between the bus and HGA.
 
      The orbit insertion stage contained a STAR-48 solid rocket motor
      (SRM) that was used to provide the impulse required to perform
      the Venus Orbit Insertion (VOI) maneuver.
 
      Thermal control of the spacecraft was accomplished by a
      combination of louvers, thermal blankets, passive coatings, and
      heat dissipating elements.  The nominal operating temperature
      for the spacecraft components was between -5 and +40 degrees
      Celsius.  The thermal control subsystem maintained these
      components at the appropriate temperatures for all orientations
      of the spacecraft orbit and sun-line and for all spacecraft
      operating modes.  Electrical power was supplied by two large
      solar panels with a total area of 12.6 square meters.  This
      array was capable of producing a minimum power of 1029 W at the
      end of the nominal mission; it could rotate about its axis to
      allow tracking of the Sun despite the changing
      Earth-Sun-spacecraft geometry during the mission.  A dedicated
      sun sensor optimized power production.  Bus voltage regulation
      was controlled by the power control unit (PCU) with a shunt
      regulator for diverting excess power from the solar arrays to
      maintain power as raw power (28-35 v), regulated power at 28 vDC
      +/-0.56 vDC, and as AC at 2.4 kHz through an inverter.  Two 30
      amp-hour, 26-cell nickel cadmium batteries provided power during
      times of solar occultation and allowed normal spacecraft
      operations independent of real-time solar illumination.  These
      batteries were sized to allow a degraded mission in the event
      that one of them failed.
 
      The attitude of the Magellan spacecraft was controlled through
      the use of reaction wheels, with monopropellant rocket motors
      being used to desaturate the reaction wheels periodically.
      During both the interplanetary cruise and the orbital portions
      of the mission, attitude reference was provided by an inertial
      reference unit (IRU), updated each orbit using celestial
      references.  During the mapping part of each orbit, the
      spacecraft was initially oriented with the HGA pointing down
      toward Venus, with the exact attitude being a function of the
      spacecraft altitude and the SAR mapping objectives.  During the
      downlink transmission part of the orbit, the spacecraft was
      oriented with the HGA slightly off the Earth-line.  The low gain
      antenna (LGA) was mounted coaxially with the HGA and did not
      require pointing since it had an omnidirectional beam pattern.
      The altimeter horn (ALTA) was mounted so that a portion of the
      fan-shaped beam nominally pointed in the nadir direction during
      the mapping part of an orbit.
 
      The Magellan propulsion subsystem consisted of two parts.  The
      first, a Star 48 SRM, provided the impulse for VOI.  Following
      that maneuver, the empty casing and parts of its support
      structure were ejected from the spacecraft.  The second part
      consisted of monopropellant hydrazine thrusters that were used
      for trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) during inter-
      planetary cruise, thrust vector control (TVC) during VOI, orbit
      trim maneuvers during the mapping mission, and attitude control
      when the reaction wheels were being desaturated.  The rocket
      motors were clustered in modules located on the end of outrigger
      booms in order to increase their moment arms and thus decrease
      attitude control propellant requirements.
 
      Twelve 0.9-N (Newton) and four 22-N rocket motors were used for
      attitude control, with thrust being provided by eight 445-N
      rocket motors or by the 0.9-N motors for small TCMs.  All
      engines pointed in the -Z direction, with the exception of the
      roll motors.
 
      The 0.9-N motors were used for tip-off control following
      separation of the inertial upper stage (IUS), reaction wheel
      desaturation, roll control for all times other than VOI, to back
      up any failed reaction wheels, and for small TCMs or orbit trim
      maneuvers (OTMs).  The 22-N motors were used for roll control
      during VOI.  The 445-N motors were used for controlling the
      spacecraft rotational axis during VOI, and to provide impulses
      during all propulsive maneuvers.  The monopropellant motors also
      provided the impulses needed to trim the VOI maneuver.
 
      The command, data and data storage (CDDS) system received uplink
      commands via the radio frequency subsystem (RFS) and controlled
      the spacecraft in response to those commands.  It also
      controlled the acquisition and storage of scientific data and
      sending that data, along with supplemental engineering data, to
      the RFS for downlink transmission to Earth.  The commands were
      sent to the spacecraft as time-event pairs for storage and later
      execution, and also in the form of blocks which the CDDS later
      expanded into spacecraft executable commands.  In the Venus
      orbit phase, commands for up to three days of radar operation
      were stored.  There was also a provision for receiving and
      executing discrete commands sent from the ground.  SAR data were
      stored on two multi-track digital tape records (DTRs) for later
      playback over the high-rate X-band link; there was no provision
      for real-time transmission of the SAR data.  Data storage
      capacity of the two DTRs was approximately 1.8 billion bits.
      Engineering data were normally transmitted to Earth over a
      real-time S-band link.  During those times when a real-time link
      was not possible, the engineering data were recorded on a DTR
      and played back via the X-band high-rate link with the SAR data.
      The recorded data stream was alternately switched between the
      two DTRs so that the data would not be lost during the DTR track
      change.
 
      The Magellan telecommunications subsystem contained all the

      the spacecraft.  The subsystem contained the radio frequency
      subsystem, the LGA, MGA, and HGA.  The RFS performed the

      operations.  The S-band operated at a transmitter power of 5 W,
      while the X-band operated at a power of 22 W.  Uplink data rates
      were 31.25 and 62.5 bps (bits per second) with downlink data
      rates of 40 bps (emergency only), 1200 bps (real-time
      engineering rate), 115.2 kbps (kilobits per second) (radar

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
 
    Mariner 10 was the seventh successful launch in the Mariner series
    and the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull of one planet
    (Venus) to reach another (Mercury). The spacecraft flew by Mercury
    three times in a heliocentric orbit and returned images and data on
    the planet. Mariner 10 is the only spacecraft to have visited
    Mercury.
 
    Spacecraft and Subsystems
 
    The spacecraft structure was an eight-sided framework with eight
    electronics compartments. It measured 1.39 m diagonally and 0.457 m
    in depth. Two solar panels, each 2.7 m long and 0.97 m wide, were
    attached at the top, supporting 5.1 sq m of solar cell area. The
    rocket engine was liquid-fueled, with two sets of reaction jets used
    to stabilize the spacecraft on three axes. It carried a low-gain
    omnidirectional antenna, composed of a honeycomb-disk parabolic
    reflector, 1.37 m in diameter, with focal length 55 cm. Feeds
    enabled the spacecraft to transmit at S- and X-band frequencies. The
    spacecraft carried a Canopus star tracker, located on the upper ring
    structure of the octagonal satellite, and acquisition sun sensors on
    the tips of the solar panels. The interior of the spacecraft was
    insulated with multiplayer thermal blankets at top and bottom. A
    sunshade was deployed after launch to protect the spacecraft on the
    solar-oriented side.
 
    Instruments on-board the spacecraft measured the atmospheric,
    surface, and physical characteristics of Mercury and Venus.
    Experiments included television photography, magnetic field, plasma,
    infrared radiometry, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and radio science
    detectors. An experimental X-band, high-frequency transmitter was
    flown for the first time on this spacecraft.
 
    Mission Profile
 
    Mariner 10 was placed in a parking orbit after launch for
    approximately 25 minutes, then placed in orbit around the Sun en
    route to Venus. The orbit direction was opposite to the motion of
    the Earth around the Sun. Mid-course corrections were made. The
    spacecraft passed Venus on February 5, 1974, at a distance of 4200
    km. It crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974, at 2046 UT,
    at a distance of about 703 km from the surface. The TV and UV
    experiments were turned on the comet Kohoutek while the spacecraft
    was on the way to Venus. A second encounter with Mercury, when more
    photographs were taken, occurred on September 21, 1974, at an
    altitude of about 47,000 km. A third and last Mercury encounter at
    an altitude of 327 km, with additional photography of about 300
    photographs and magnetic field measurements occurred on March 16,
    1975. Engineering tests were continued until March 24, 1975, when
    the supply of attitude-control gas was depleted and the mission was
    terminated.
 
    Total research, deployment, launch, and support costs for the
    Mariner series of spacecraft (Mariners 1 through 10) was
    approximately $554 million.

  ================
    The Earth and Sun cross Saturn's ring plane every 13-15 years.
    Because of the orbital characteristics of Saturn and Earth,
    these ring plane crossing (RPX) events can be either triple
    (with Earth crossing the ring plane three times) or single
    (with Earth crossing the ring plane only once).  Single
    crossings generally occur with Saturn very close to solar
    conjunction, and so are difficult to observe from the Earth.
    Triple crossings are generally much more favorable to
    Earth-based observers.
 
    The period around a Saturn RPX enables Earth-based astronomers to
    study a wide range of phenomena not observable at any other
    time.  Direct measurements of ring thickness and vertical ring
    warps become possible.  Precise timing of the crossings make it
    possible to better determine Saturn's rotation pole.  With the
    rings becoming very thin and faint, detections of faint outer
    rings and tiny ring-moons become possible.  Also, satellite
    eclipses, occultations and mutual events during the RPX period
    can be used to refine satellite orbits throughout the Saturn
    system.
 
    A triple RPX occurred in 1995-1996.  Earth passed through the
    plane of Saturn's rings on May 22, 1995, August 10, 1995 and
    February 11, 1996.  Of these events, only the third was
    difficult to observe due to Saturn's proximity to the Sun.  The
    Sun also crossed the ring plane as well, November 17-21, 1995.
    Astronomers carried out a wide range of Saturn observations
    during this period.
 
    The next two Saturn RPXs crossings will be unfavorable from
    Earth: they are both single events occurring on 4 September
    2009 and 23 March 2025.  Earth-based observers will not get a
    favorable edge-on view of Saturn's rings until the triple RPX
    events of 2038-2039.
 
    Although no formal NASA 'mission' was organized for the 1995
    RPX, data acquired for Saturn and its rings and moons were some
    of the best obtained since the Voyager encounters and serve as
    a useful bridge to the upcoming Cassini mission in 2004-2008.
    To foster the combined analysis of data from different sources
    and thereby to maximize the scientific return from this
    'mission', the PDS Rings Node is archiving data from the
    1995-1996 RPX in a series of CDROMs.
 
 
  Mission Phases
  ==============
    Four major events occurred during the Saturn ring plane
    crossing period---three Earth crossings and one Sun crossing.
    The mission phases listed below have been chosen somewhat
    arbitrarily to be centered on these four events, plus the two
    extended periods before and after the crossings.
 
 
    PRE-RPX
    -------
      The pre-RPX phase extended up to the time approximately three
      weeks before Earth's first ring plane crossing.

      ring plane, which occurred from approximately 18:15 UTC 17
      November 1995 to 12:00 UTC on 21 November 1995.  At this time
      Earth's viewpoint was approximately 2.6 degrees north of the

      final Earth crossing of Saturn's ring plane, which occurred
      at approximately 23:36 UTC on 11 February 1996.  This was a
      crossing from the north (unlit) side to the south (lit) side.
      This period occurred rather close to solar conjunction and so
      was not well observed.

    The period around a Saturn RPX enables Earth-based astronomers to

    warps become possible.  Precise timing of the crossings make it
    possible to better determine Saturn's rotation pole.  With the
    rings becoming very thin and faint, detections of faint outer
    rings and tiny ring-moons become possible.  Also, satellite
    eclipses, occultations and mutual events during the RPX period
    can be used to refine satellite orbits throughout the Saturn
    system.

    The next two Saturn RPXs crossings will be unfavorable from

    favorable edge-on view of Saturn's rings until the triple RPX
    events of 2038-2039.
 
    Although no formal NASA 'mission' was organized for the 1995
    RPX, data acquired for Saturn and its rings and moons were some
    of the best obtained since the Voyager encounters and serve as
    a useful bridge to the upcoming Cassini mission in 2004-2008.
    To foster the combined analysis of data from different sources

<field name="investigation_objectives_summary"><![CDATA[Mission Objectives Overview
  ===========================
 
    Faint Rings
    -----------
      Observations of Saturn's faint E, F and G Rings are best made
      when the main rings are especially dark, such as close to the
      moments of the Earth crossings and during the brief periods
      when the Sun and Earth are on opposite sides of the ring
      plane.  Observations reveal radial and vertical structures,
      illuminating, for example, the relationship between the E
      Ring and the embedded moon Enceladus.  Photometry and
      spectrophotometry over a range of phase angles can be used to
      better define the particle population in each ring.
 
 
    Ring Thickness and Event Timing
    -------------------------------
      Observations of the photometric thickness of the rings, as
      seen edge-on, may reveal whether this is caused by bending
      waves, embedded moons, contributions from the projected E, F,
      and G Rings, or some combination of the above.
 
      Stellar occultations have led to a tentative detection of the
      precession of the ring plane due to solar torques, and the
      observed rate implies an advance of ~2 hours in the time of
      RPX during the 15-year interval since the Voyager encounters.
      Accurate timing of the crossing(s) could result in a
      confirmation of this precession rate, or at least provide an
      essential zero-point for future studies.
 
 
    'Dark Side' Ring Viewing
    ------------------------
      Observations of the 'dark side' of the main rings are
      possible during two extended periods when Sun and Earth are
      on opposite sides of the ring plane: 21 May-11 August 1995
      and 19 November 1995-11 February 1996.  During the latter
      period, Earth is up to 2.5 degrees above the ring plane while
      the Sun is in or below the plane, offering an excellent
      opportunity to observe light transmitted through the C Ring
      and the Cassini Division.  Photometry in these unusual
      viewing geometries provides a unique set of constraints on
      models of light scattering by denser planetary rings.
 
 
    Detections of Small Satellites
    ------------------------------
      The small Saturnian satellites Pan, Atlas, Prometheus,
      Pandora, Helene, Telesto, and Calypso have not been seen
      since the Voyager encounters.  Janus and Epimetheus have been
      seen only rarely.  New detections will make it possible to
      refine their orbits substantially.  In addition, periods of
      ring plane crossing are ideal for detecting previously unseen
      moons.
 
 
    Satellite Eclipses and Mutual Events
    ------------------------------------
      During the period 1993-1996 a very large number of eclipses
      and occultations of the satellites by Saturn (and some by the
      rings) will take place, as well as an extensive set of mutual
      satellite occultations and eclipses in 1995.  Most eclipses
      commence in October 1994 and continue through to August 1996,
      but are most readily observed well away from opposition or
      conjunction.  The mutual events, which occur only near the
      passages of Earth through the ring plane, last from January
      1995 to September 1996, with the highest frequency in
      November 1995-January 1996.
 
      A large set of mutual event observations in 1995 should lead
      to significant improvements in the orbits for all the inner
      satellites (S1-S6), and may help to establish better the
      amplitudes and frequencies of the resonant librations
      involving S1-S4.  Such observations may also permit mapping
      of albedo patterns on the satellites.]]></field>

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
    ================
      On November 14, 1971, Mariner 9 became the first spacecraft to
      orbit another planet.  Six experiments were carried as part of
      the science payload: television, ultraviolet spectrometer,
      infrared spectroscopy, infrared radiometry, S-band occultation
      and celestial mechanics.  Two experiments (S-band occultation
      and celestial mechanics) utilized the radio telemetry subsystem
      to derive data; the other required specially developed
      instruments, mounted, and boresighted to each other, on the
      spacecraft's scan platform.   Pre-launch mission planning
      encompassed two separate, but complementary, missions.  The
      orbit of each spacecraft was optimized to match the
      corresponding objective.  The mapping mission was designed with
      an Earth-synchronous orbit (about a 12-hr periods) to maximize
      antenna utilization, or communications efficiency.  For maximum
      surveillance of an area, it was designed with a steep
      inclination (80 degrees) to the equatorial plane of Mars.  The
      dynamic objective dictated a Mars-synchronous (or
      sub-synchronous) orbit and a lower (50 degree) inclination for
      closer observations of specific areas.  The plans for the two
      missions were in detailed stages of development on May 9, 1971
      when Mariner 8 was lost because of guidance difficulties in the
      second stage of the launch vehicle.   It was determined that an
      orbit for a single-spacecraft mission could be developed to meet
      all basic mission and specific science objectives.  A
      single-spacecraft plan, involving an inclination of 65 degrees,
      a period of about 12 hours, a periapsis altitude of 1350 Km, and
      an arrival date of November 14, 1971, was evaluated and
      formalized in 2 weeks.

        than 50 years.
 
 
    Mission Phases
    ==============
 
      CRUISE
      ------
        On June 5th, a planned trajectory correction was made.
        Martian ephemeris data and spacecraft tracking calculations
        were determined with such accuracy that no other midcourse
        corrections were necessary during the 167 day flight to Mars.
        Other events during cruise were scan calibration no.  1 on
        October 1, scan calibration no.  2 on October 8, Mars TV
        calibration on November 8 and November 9.

      LAUNCH
      ------
        Mariner 9 was successfully launched from Cape Kennedy, Florida
        at 6:23 PM EDT.  The Centaur-Mariner 9 separation occurred at
        6:36 PM EDT.

        Spacecraft Operations Type     : ORBITER
 
 
      ORBITAL
      -------
        The 1398 Km periapsis altitude of the insertion orbit was
        accurate to with 50 Km from the aiming point, and the initial
        period of 12 hr and 34 min was within seconds of the time
        desired for the insertion orbit.  The non-synchronization with
        Earth provided the timing slip until coincidence of the
        Goldstone 64-m antenna zenith position and orbit periapsis was
        obtained and a trim maneuver 'locked' the two into
        synchronization.   On November 16, the spacecrafts' orbital
        period was changed by more than 30 min by a 6-sec firing of
        the rocket engines.  However, because of the previously
        unknown gravity-field variation of the planet the average
        orbital period was found to be slightly shorter that the
        11:58:52 planned, gradually changing the time relationship of
        periapsis to the view period of the 64-m antenna at Goldstone,
        California, which would eventually affect data playbacks.   On
        December 30 (revolution 94), a second trim maneuver adjusted
        the orbital period, correcting periapsis-passage timing with
        the view period of the 64-m antenna.  This new orbit
        established a higher periapsis altitude, which provided a
        broader area coverage for each television picture, thus
        requiring fewer picture to complete the desired mapping of 70%
        of the surface during the standard 90 day mission.  The
        broader area coverage for each pictured resulted in a
        corresponding loss of surface resolution.   About 122 days
        after orbit insertion, the pointing direction of the
        spacecraft's high-gain antenna drifted off of Earth, and
        communications became more difficult.  A high-gain antenna
        maneuver (HGAM) of the spacecraft became necessary to point
        the antenna to Earth.   On October 27, 1972, telemetry data
        indicated that the spacecraft was no longer capable of holding
        the fixed attitude and, as the last battery power was being
        used, a final command was sent to stop transmitting.  The
        slowly tumbling Mariner 9 will remain in orbit for a minimum
        of 50 years before it enters the atmosphere of Mars,
        disintegrates, and falls to the surface.

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
    ================
      The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) was launched
      successfully on 26 January 1978, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The
      satellite was developed to provide a general facility for observing
      ultraviolet (UV) spectra of astronomical sources over the wavelength
      range from about 1150 A to 3200 A.  The project has been a joint
      undertaking in which the US National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration (NASA) provided the spacecraft, the optical and
      mechanical components of the scientific instrument, the US ground
      observatory and spacecraft control software; the UK Science Research
      Council (SRC) in collaboration with University College London (UCL)
      provided the television cameras used to record the spectroscopic
      data; and the European Space Agency (ESA) provided the solar arrays
      and European ground observatory. The image processing software was
      developed jointly by NASA and the SRC's Appleton Laboratory. The
      satellite has been placed in geosynchronous orbit over the Atlantic
      Ocean and is operated for 16h each day, for NASA sponsored
      observers, from the US ground observatory located at the Goddard
      Space Flight Center (GSFC) near Washington, D.C., and for the

      European ground observatory located near Madrid.
 
      A synchronous orbit has other advantages. Because the Earth subtends
      an angle of only 17 degrees the unconstrained area of sky is much
      greater than for low orbits and, as its movement along the ecliptic
      is at the diurnal rate, the occurrence of occultations is
      infrequent. Consequently, over large portions of the sky, neither
      long exposures nor the observation of variable phenomena need be
      periodically interrupted. A penalty is that in synchronous orbit
      observations are normally made in full sunlight so the telescope
      must be baffled to ensure adequate rejection of stray sunlight and
      earthlight.  The offset guiding system can be influenced, however,
      and relatively bright guide stars are needed near the Earth's limb.

    ================
      The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) was launched
      successfully on 26 January 1978, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The
      satellite was developed to provide a general facility for observing
      ultraviolet (UV) spectra of astronomical sources over the wavelength
      range from about 1150 A to 3200 A.  The project has been a joint
      undertaking in which the US National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration (NASA) provided the spacecraft, the optical and
      mechanical components of the scientific instrument, the US ground
      observatory and spacecraft control software; the UK Science Research
      Council (SRC) in collaboration with University College London (UCL)
      provided the television cameras used to record the spectroscopic
      data; and the European Space Agency (ESA) provided the solar arrays
      and European ground observatory. The image processing software was
      developed jointly by NASA and the SRC's Appleton Laboratory. The
      satellite has been placed in geosynchronous orbit over the Atlantic
      Ocean and is operated for 16h each day, for NASA sponsored
      observers, from the US ground observatory located at the Goddard
      Space Flight Center (GSFC) near Washington, D.C., and for the
      remaining 8h by ESA, for ESA and UK sponsored observers, from the
      European ground observatory located near Madrid.

<field name="investigation_objectives_summary"><![CDATA[DESIGN CONCEPTS
    ---------------
      It was decided that a high spectral resolution of the order of 0.2 A
      would be required to study the atmospheric characteristics of bright
      stars and planets and that a lower resolution of about 6 A should be
      available to obtain information on faint sources. In addition, two
      other requirements were fundamental in determining the design of the
      scientific instrument and of the spacecraft to support it: first,
      the instrument should be able to record simultaneous data over large
      spectral ranges and, second, the spacecraft should be able to take
      maximum advantage of the observer's real-time judgement concerning
      the quality and content of his data.
 
      The latter requires good communication between the spacecraft and
      the observer so a geosynchronous orbit was chosen. The IUE orbit
      allows continuous real-time control from the NASA control centre and
      at least 10h each day from the ESA control centre. The arrangement
      is fundamentally different from low altitude orbiting observatories
      which have to acquire data while remote from ground control. In the
      case of IUE, control and performance monitoring are exercised
      continuously. The telescope field is displayed to the observer, who
      identifies his target star and directs the course of the observation
      in real-time. The 'IUE observatory', thus comprises the ground
      control centre, where the astronomer views his television monitors,
      and the optical and electronic instrumentation located in
      synchronous orbit.]]></field>

================
Venus Express is ESA's first mission to Venus. It reuses the design
of the Mars Express spacecraft. Many of the instruments are simply
upgraded versions of those developed for ESA's Mars Express and
Rosetta missions. The scientific objectives of the mission is to
study the atmosphere, the plasma environment, and the surface of
Venus in great detail.
 
Venus Express was launched by a Soyuz-Fregat launcher from the
Baikonour Cosmodrome on 9 November 2005. After separation, Venus
Express, of mass 1244 kg,was placed into an interplanetary transfer
orbit during approximately 150 days. After a 153 day cruise to Venus
the spacecraft entered Venusian orbit on 11 april 2006. The first
capture orbit was an eccentric polar and lasted 9 days. Several
manoeuvres over the period 15 April-6 May 2006 lowered the spacecraft
into its operational orbit: a 24-hour elliptical, quasi-polar orbit.
The pericentre altitude is 250 kms and the apocentre altitude is
66000 kms.
 
Pericentre altitude                    250 km
Apocentre altitude                     66000 km
Period                                 24 h

Pericentre latitude                    80 deg
 
The mission has been described in many papers [ESA2005;
HUNTER2004]. Details about the mission launch sequence and timeline
can be obtained from the Mission Calendar [DAUVIN2005] and from
the Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis (CREMA)
[SANCHEZ&RODRIGU2005].
 
Mission Phases
==============
The mission timeline defines the different spacecraft and payload
operations required per phase to prepare the spacecraft for Venus
operational orbit acquisition, science data acquisition and
transmission.
The pre-routine mission phase, which are:
    - the pre-launch phase
    - the launch and early orbit phase
    - the near earth commissioning phase
    - the interplanetary cruise phase
    - the venus orbit insertion phase
    - the venus orbit commissioning phase,
the nominal mission phase and the extended mission phases phase are
detailed below.
 
PRELAUNCH
---------
Pre-launch operations started approximately 6 months before the
launch and covered the period from delivery of the spacecraft to the
launch site until L-8 hrs in the launch countdown sequence. During
this period the Venus Express Mission Operations Centre (VMOC) at
ESOC performed its final simulation programme including the validation
of the Flight Operations Plan (FOP) and the final mission control
system.
     mission phase start time : ~ June 2005
     mission phase stop time  : 2005-11-09
 
LAUNCH AND EARLY ORBIT PHASE (LEOP)
-----------------------------------
 
The Venus Express spacecraft was launched on a Soyouz-Fregat rocket
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 3:33:34 UT on 9 November 2005.
 
The three-stage Soyuz launcher lifted the Fregat autonomous upper
stage (fourth stage) with Venus Express mounted on it into a
sub-orbital trajectory.
 
After separation from the Soyuz third stage, a Fregat main engine
burn (at an altitude of about 200 kilometres) for around 20 seconds
placed the Fregat-Venus Express composite into an almost circular
parking orbit. After a coast phase of about 70 minutes in the low
Earth orbit, a second Fregat engine burn, lasting 16 minutes, moved
the combined craft from the parking orbit onto an escape trajectory,
after which the Fregat stage and Venus Express separated.
 
     Duration                 : 3 days
     mission phase start time : 2005-11-09
     mission phase stop time  : 2005-11-11
 
After separation, Venus Express spent approximately 150 days in an
interplanetary transfer orbit. During this phase, trajectory
corrections were performed using the spacecraft's own thrusters.
 
NEAR EARTH COMMISSIONING PHASE (NECP)
-------------------------------------
 
It included the following activities for the spacecraft:
     - spacecraft commissioning.
     - deployment of the MAG Boom.
     - Payloads commissioning.
 
     Duration                 : 3 weeks
     mission phase start time : 2005-11-12
     mission phase stop time  : 2005-12-16
 
INTERPLANETARY CRUISE PHASE
---------------------------
 
The Interplanetary Cruise Phase finished about one month before Venus
capture. During this 3 months phase, the spacecraft was on the
Sun-centred ballistic orbit to Venus. Most of this phase was not
dedicated to any specific activity, except the cruise orbit
determination and correction.
 
     Duration                 : 107 days
     mission phase start time : 2005-12-17
     mission phase stop time  : 2006-04-04
 
VENUS ORBIT INSERTION PHASE (VOI)
---------------------------
 
The Venus Orbit Insertion (VOI) phase was the period of transition
between the Interplanetary Cruise phase and the final operational
orbit around Venus. It started before the Venus capture manoeuvre and
ended when the satellite reached the operational orbit. The duration
of this phase was about 2 weeks.
 
A final course adjustment was performed on 29 March to fine tune the
arrival hyperbola for Venus Orbit Insertion. The VOI manoeuvre took
place on 11 April 2006. To enable capture of the spacecraft, it was
first slewed such that the main engine was aligned to the direction
of travel.
 
The main engine burn lasted around 50 minutes and decelerated the
spacecraft by approximately 1251 ms-1 (~ 4500 kmh-1).
 
The spacecraft initially entered a highly elliptical polar orbit with
a pericentre of 400 km, an apocentre of 350 000 km and a period of 9
days.
 
To achieve the final operational orbit a series of correction
manoeuvres were necessary:

     Duration                 : 16 days
     mission phase start time : 2006-04-05
     venus capture manoeuvre  : 2006-04-11
     mission phase stop time  : 2006-04-21
 
VENUS ORBIT COMMISSIONING PHASE
---------------------------------
 
The Venus Payload Commissioning phase started when the spacecraft
reached the operational orbit and ended when it was declared ready for
science data acquisition and transmission to the Earth.
 
It was dedicated to spacecraft commissioning activities, payloads
commissioning and demonstration activities prior to operational
science operations.
The duration of the Payload Commissioning phase around Venus was about
1 month.
The operations to be performed during the phase were the following:
     - S/C in-orbit commissioning,
     - Payloads in-orbit commissioning,
     - Isolation of the Propulsion system.
 
     Duration                 : 42 days
     mission phase start time : 2006-04-22
     mission phase stop time  : 2006-06-03
 
ROUTINE OPERATIONS PHASE
------------------------
 
The selected operational orbit was inertially fixed, so that coverage
of all planetocentric longitudes was accomplished in one Venus
sidereal day (243 Earth days). The nominal mission orbital lifetime
was two Venus sidereal days (486 Earth days). It consisted in science
data acquisition from the payloads, data storage in the SSMM and data
transmission to the Earth.
 
There were two different phases of operations for Venus Express once
it was in operational orbit: the Earth Pointing phase and the
Observation phase.
 
The Earth pointing phase was dedicated to communication with Earth and
battery charging. It was used whenever the spacecraft was not in the
observation phase. In the Earth pointing phase, one of the two High
Gain Antennas was oriented towards Earth. The antenna was selected
according to the season, so that the spacecraft's cold face remained
always protected from illumination by the Sun.
The rotation angle around the Earth direction was optimised in order
to avoid any entrance of Sun light on the side walls radiators.
High rate communication was performed 8 hours per day in X-band, in
order to transmit to Earth all science data stored in the Solid
State Mass Memory.
An average of 2 Gbits of science data was downlinked every day to the
new ESA ground station of Cebreros, Spain.
 
The observation phase consisted of several different modes of
observation, depending on the payload configuration and spacecraft
orientation: Nadir pointing, Limb observation, Star occultation,
Radio science.
 
During observation, the Sun could illuminate under transient
conditions any spacecraft face, except for the cold face. The duration
of observation was therefore limited by thermal constraints and by
battery discharge. The maximum duration of an observation period
depended on the Sun direction with respect to the orbit plane, which
varied along the mission.
 
Observations and spacecraft activities were planned based on the
following principles:
  1. Complete and uniform the coverage of the science themes
  2. Balance between distant and close-up view of Venus
  3. Balance between observations of the Northern and Southern
  hemisphere
  4. Synergy between experiments in covering science objectives
  5. Use of two cases in each orbit: one in apocentre, one in
  pericentre
  6. Even distribution of pericentric cases with priority given to the
  solar and Earth radio occultation experiments in specific seasons
  7. Apocentric cases (2,3) were grouped in campaigns of 10 orbits
  that was required by the atmospheric dynamics mission objectives
  8. Maximum compliance with the current flight rules.
 
Individual Objectives per Instrument
------------------------------------
 
ASPERA
On during the entire mission and permanently collecting data.
Survey observations in the beginning of the mission and more specific
and detailed observations on selected part of the orbit later in the
mission. Data was collected at different rates depending on the
selected mode.
 
MAG
On during the entire mission and permanently collecting data. Data was
collected at different rates depending on the selected mode.
 
SPICAV
The main goal of SPICAV was to sound the Venus atmosphere in solar and
stellar occultation geometry with sufficient latitude and local time
coverage. SPICAV did also nadir and corona observations (90 deg slew
from nadir pointing and back to nadir).
 
VeRa
4 types of observations
1. Earth occultation with as good as possible latitude and local time
coverage of Venus.
2. Bi-static sounding of surface targets. The radio signal was sent to
selected targets on the Venus surface. Reflected and scattered signal
was received by ground station. As the signal was weak, the experiment
depended on the Earth Venus distance, geometry and surface target
properties.
3. Solar Corona observations in vincinity of conjunctions.
4. Gravity anomaly. It consisted in the precise tracking of the s/c
while it passes over global geological formations on Venus solid body.
It has been carried out only twice during the nominal mission . The
Gravity Anomaly observations have been abandoned since the end of the
nominal mission as the added scientific value with respect to previous
observations was very small.
 
 
     Duration                 : 486 days
     mission phase start time : 2006-06-04
     mission phase stop time  : 2007-10-02
 
EXTENDED OPERATIONS PHASE
-------------------------
 
The nominal mission ended on October 2, 2007 when started the first
extended mission. The first extended mission phase was approved until
May 2009, end of MTP 040, May 30th, orbit 1135. It was followed by the
second mission extension from MTP 041 that started in May, 31 2009
(orbit 1136). The second extension was followed by the third extension
that started with MTP 057, August 22nd 2010, orbit 1584. The third
extension ended with MTP 085 in December 2012.

  EXTENSION 1, 2, 3: General Observation strategy
  -----------------------------------------------
 
  The first extended mission had the following objectives:
    - Improve and complete spatial and temporal observational coverage
    - Study in detail the phenomena discovered in the nominal mission
    - Take advantage of the new operation modes (case #2 pendulum,
    spot pointing, ...)
    - Perform pericentre lowering down to the altitude that still
    allows usual operations without entering aerobraking mode
    (around 170-270 km)
    - Perform necessary studies and tests preparing the spacecraft for
    future aerobraking campaign
  These goals determined the following planning outline for the
  extended mission:
    - October 3, 2007 - May 31, 2008 (MTP 19-27): like nominal mission
    - June 2008 - TBD operations with low pericentre.
    - TBD: Aerobraking campaign.
 
  Pericentre lowering campaign:
  The pericentre altitude was maintained between 250 km and 350 km
  during the first 8 months of the extended mission. After May 31,
  2008 the pericentre was lowered to the corridor 170-220 km. This
  pericentre lowering aimed at observing plasma at this altitude
  range. The apocentre and the pericentre latitude hasn't changed
  (66000 km, about 78 deg).
 
Science Subphase
----------------
For the purpose of structuring further the payload operations
planning, the mission phases were further divided into science
subphases.

This initial phase was devoted to the spacecraft and payload checkout
and in orbit commissioning. The phase consisted of:
- experiments commissioning (until 14 May 2006, orb 23).
- Science case commissioning (16-27 May 2006, Orb 23-36).
- Extended case commissioning (May 28-June 3, Orb 37-43). The ECC
also occupied the first half of phase 1.
The phase contained the first eclipse season that ends at orbit 40.

-------
Phase 1 was favorable for observations of the evening terminator
vicinity. In particular, the following observation were performed:
- Cloud observations;
- lightning on the night side;
- stellar occultation on the dark limb (north/south asymmetry of the
aerosol vertical structure);
- Solar occultation (horizontal structure of hazes above the main
cloud deck);
- Thermal mapping of Ishtar Terra and Maxwell Montes;
- Limb observations (vertical structure of haze layers);
- Observations of nightglows (O2, NO ...), their latitude and

Moreover, about every 6 months a SSMM problem (named SCET problem)
occurs for about 15 minutes. During this time, the spacecraft cannot
record data and the data is lost. This problem does not really affect
archive but it is put in the mission catalog as a general information.]]></field>

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
================
Venus Express is ESA's first mission to Venus. It reuses the design
of the Mars Express spacecraft. Many of the instruments are simply
upgraded versions of those developed for ESA's Mars Express and
Rosetta missions. The scientific objectives of the mission is to
study the atmosphere, the plasma environment, and the surface of
Venus in great detail.
 
Venus Express was launched by a Soyuz-Fregat launcher from the
Baikonour Cosmodrome on 9 November 2005. After separation, Venus
Express, of mass 1244 kg,was placed into an interplanetary transfer
orbit during approximately 150 days. After a 153 day cruise to Venus
the spacecraft entered Venusian orbit on 11 april 2006. The first
capture orbit was an eccentric polar and lasted 9 days. Several
manoeuvres over the period 15 April-6 May 2006 lowered the spacecraft
into its operational orbit: a 24-hour elliptical, quasi-polar orbit.
The pericentre altitude is 250 kms and the apocentre altitude is
66000 kms.

The mission has been described in many papers [ESA2005;
HUNTER2004]. Details about the mission launch sequence and timeline
can be obtained from the Mission Calendar [DAUVIN2005] and from
the Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis (CREMA)
[SANCHEZ&RODRIGU2005].
 
Mission Phases
==============
The mission timeline defines the different spacecraft and payload
operations required per phase to prepare the spacecraft for Venus
operational orbit acquisition, science data acquisition and
transmission.
The pre-routine mission phase, which are:
    - the pre-launch phase
    - the launch and early orbit phase
    - the near earth commissioning phase
    - the interplanetary cruise phase
    - the venus orbit insertion phase
    - the venus orbit commissioning phase,
the nominal mission phase and the extended mission phases phase are
detailed below.
 
PRELAUNCH
---------
Pre-launch operations started approximately 6 months before the
launch and covered the period from delivery of the spacecraft to the
launch site until L-8 hrs in the launch countdown sequence. During
this period the Venus Express Mission Operations Centre (VMOC) at
ESOC performed its final simulation programme including the validation
of the Flight Operations Plan (FOP) and the final mission control
system.
     mission phase start time : ~ June 2005
     mission phase stop time  : 2005-11-09
 
LAUNCH AND EARLY ORBIT PHASE (LEOP)
-----------------------------------
 
The Venus Express spacecraft was launched on a Soyouz-Fregat rocket
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 3:33:34 UT on 9 November 2005.
 
The three-stage Soyuz launcher lifted the Fregat autonomous upper
stage (fourth stage) with Venus Express mounted on it into a
sub-orbital trajectory.
 
After separation from the Soyuz third stage, a Fregat main engine
burn (at an altitude of about 200 kilometres) for around 20 seconds
placed the Fregat-Venus Express composite into an almost circular
parking orbit. After a coast phase of about 70 minutes in the low
Earth orbit, a second Fregat engine burn, lasting 16 minutes, moved
the combined craft from the parking orbit onto an escape trajectory,
after which the Fregat stage and Venus Express separated.
 
     Duration                 : 3 days
     mission phase start time : 2005-11-09
     mission phase stop time  : 2005-11-11
 
After separation, Venus Express spent approximately 150 days in an
interplanetary transfer orbit. During this phase, trajectory
corrections were performed using the spacecraft's own thrusters.
 
NEAR EARTH COMMISSIONING PHASE (NECP)
-------------------------------------
 
It included the following activities for the spacecraft:
     - spacecraft commissioning.
     - deployment of the MAG Boom.
     - Payloads commissioning.
 
     Duration                 : 3 weeks
     mission phase start time : 2005-11-12
     mission phase stop time  : 2005-12-16
 
INTERPLANETARY CRUISE PHASE
---------------------------
 
The Interplanetary Cruise Phase finished about one month before Venus
capture. During this 3 months phase, the spacecraft was on the
Sun-centred ballistic orbit to Venus. Most of this phase was not
dedicated to any specific activity, except the cruise orbit
determination and correction.
 
     Duration                 : 107 days
     mission phase start time : 2005-12-17
     mission phase stop time  : 2006-04-04
 
VENUS ORBIT INSERTION PHASE (VOI)
---------------------------
 
The Venus Orbit Insertion (VOI) phase was the period of transition
between the Interplanetary Cruise phase and the final operational
orbit around Venus. It started before the Venus capture manoeuvre and
ended when the satellite reached the operational orbit. The duration
of this phase was about 2 weeks.
 
A final course adjustment was performed on 29 March to fine tune the
arrival hyperbola for Venus Orbit Insertion. The VOI manoeuvre took
place on 11 April 2006. To enable capture of the spacecraft, it was
first slewed such that the main engine was aligned to the direction
of travel.
 
The main engine burn lasted around 50 minutes and decelerated the
spacecraft by approximately 1251 ms-1 (~ 4500 kmh-1).
 
The spacecraft initially entered a highly elliptical polar orbit with
a pericentre of 400 km, an apocentre of 350 000 km and a period of 9
days.
 
To achieve the final operational orbit a series of correction
manoeuvres were necessary:

     mission phase stop time  : 2006-04-21
 
VENUS ORBIT COMMISSIONING PHASE
---------------------------------
 
The Venus Payload Commissioning phase started when the spacecraft
reached the operational orbit and ended when it was declared ready for
science data acquisition and transmission to the Earth.
 
It was dedicated to spacecraft commissioning activities, payloads
commissioning and demonstration activities prior to operational
science operations.
The duration of the Payload Commissioning phase around Venus was about
1 month.
The operations to be performed during the phase were the following:
     - S/C in-orbit commissioning,
     - Payloads in-orbit commissioning,
     - Isolation of the Propulsion system.
 
     Duration                 : 42 days
     mission phase start time : 2006-04-22
     mission phase stop time  : 2006-06-03
 
ROUTINE OPERATIONS PHASE
------------------------
 
The selected operational orbit was inertially fixed, so that coverage
of all planetocentric longitudes was accomplished in one Venus
sidereal day (243 Earth days). The nominal mission orbital lifetime
was two Venus sidereal days (486 Earth days). It consisted in science
data acquisition from the payloads, data storage in the SSMM and data
transmission to the Earth.
 
There were two different phases of operations for Venus Express once
it was in operational orbit: the Earth Pointing phase and the
Observation phase.
 
The Earth pointing phase was dedicated to communication with Earth and
battery charging. It was used whenever the spacecraft was not in the
observation phase. In the Earth pointing phase, one of the two High
Gain Antennas was oriented towards Earth. The antenna was selected
according to the season, so that the spacecraft's cold face remained
always protected from illumination by the Sun.
The rotation angle around the Earth direction was optimised in order
to avoid any entrance of Sun light on the side walls radiators.
High rate communication was performed 8 hours per day in X-band, in
order to transmit to Earth all science data stored in the Solid
State Mass Memory.
An average of 2 Gbits of science data was downlinked every day to the
new ESA ground station of Cebreros, Spain.
 
The observation phase consisted of several different modes of
observation, depending on the payload configuration and spacecraft
orientation: Nadir pointing, Limb observation, Star occultation,
Radio science.
 
During observation, the Sun could illuminate under transient
conditions any spacecraft face, except for the cold face. The duration
of observation was therefore limited by thermal constraints and by
battery discharge. The maximum duration of an observation period
depended on the Sun direction with respect to the orbit plane, which
varied along the mission.
 
Observations and spacecraft activities were planned based on the
following principles:
  1. Complete and uniform the coverage of the science themes
  2. Balance between distant and close-up view of Venus
  3. Balance between observations of the Northern and Southern
  hemisphere
  4. Synergy between experiments in covering science objectives
  5. Use of two cases in each orbit: one in apocentre, one in
  pericentre
  6. Even distribution of pericentric cases with priority given to the
  solar and Earth radio occultation experiments in specific seasons
  7. Apocentric cases (2,3) were grouped in campaigns of 10 orbits
  that was required by the atmospheric dynamics mission objectives
  8. Maximum compliance with the current flight rules.
 
Individual Objectives per Instrument
------------------------------------
 
ASPERA
On during the entire mission and permanently collecting data.
Survey observations in the beginning of the mission and more specific
and detailed observations on selected part of the orbit later in the
mission. Data was collected at different rates depending on the
selected mode.
 
MAG
On during the entire mission and permanently collecting data. Data was
collected at different rates depending on the selected mode.
 
SPICAV
The main goal of SPICAV was to sound the Venus atmosphere in solar and
stellar occultation geometry with sufficient latitude and local time
coverage. SPICAV did also nadir and corona observations (90 deg slew
from nadir pointing and back to nadir).
 
VeRa
4 types of observations
1. Earth occultation with as good as possible latitude and local time
coverage of Venus.
2. Bi-static sounding of surface targets. The radio signal was sent to
selected targets on the Venus surface. Reflected and scattered signal
was received by ground station. As the signal was weak, the experiment
depended on the Earth Venus distance, geometry and surface target
properties.
3. Solar Corona observations in vincinity of conjunctions.
4. Gravity anomaly. It consisted in the precise tracking of the s/c
while it passes over global geological formations on Venus solid body.
It has been carried out only twice during the nominal mission . The
Gravity Anomaly observations have been abandoned since the end of the
nominal mission as the added scientific value with respect to previous
observations was very small.
 
 
     Duration                 : 486 days
     mission phase start time : 2006-06-04
     mission phase stop time  : 2007-10-02
 
EXTENDED OPERATIONS PHASE
-------------------------
 
The nominal mission ended on October 2, 2007 when started the first
extended mission. The first extended mission phase was approved until
May 2009, end of MTP 040, May 30th, orbit 1135. It was followed by the
second mission extension from MTP 041 that started in May, 31 2009
(orbit 1136). The second extension was followed by the third extension
that started with MTP 057, August 22nd 2010, orbit 1584. The third
extension ended with MTP 085 in December 2012.

  EXTENSION 1, 2, 3: General Observation strategy
  -----------------------------------------------
 
  The first extended mission had the following objectives:
    - Improve and complete spatial and temporal observational coverage
    - Study in detail the phenomena discovered in the nominal mission
    - Take advantage of the new operation modes (case #2 pendulum,
    spot pointing, ...)
    - Perform pericentre lowering down to the altitude that still
    allows usual operations without entering aerobraking mode
    (around 170-270 km)
    - Perform necessary studies and tests preparing the spacecraft for
    future aerobraking campaign
  These goals determined the following planning outline for the
  extended mission:
    - October 3, 2007 - May 31, 2008 (MTP 19-27): like nominal mission
    - June 2008 - TBD operations with low pericentre.
    - TBD: Aerobraking campaign.
 
  Pericentre lowering campaign:
  The pericentre altitude was maintained between 250 km and 350 km
  during the first 8 months of the extended mission. After May 31,
  2008 the pericentre was lowered to the corridor 170-220 km. This
  pericentre lowering aimed at observing plasma at this altitude
  range. The apocentre and the pericentre latitude hasn't changed
  (66000 km, about 78 deg).
 
Science Subphase
----------------
For the purpose of structuring further the payload operations
planning, the mission phases were further divided into science
subphases.

===========================
 
Background
----------
 
The first explorations (1962-1985) of Venus showed that the planet
was hidden behind a curtain of dense clouds. Despite of the
exploration by more than 20 spacecrafts, the studies gave basic
knowledge of the conditions on the planet but generated more
questions concerning the atmospheric composition, chemistry,
structure dynamics, surface-atmosphere interactions, atmospheric and
geological evolution, and the plasma environment.
 
The scientific objectives include atmospheric physics, subsurface
and surface studies, investigation of the plasma environment and
interaction of the solar wind with the atmosphere. For clarity, the
atmosphere has been divided into three parts: lower atmosphere (0-60
km), middle atmosphere (60 - 110 km), and upper atmosphere (110 - 200
km).
 
The physics, methods of investigation, and scientific goals are quite
different for each atmospheric region. However they all can be
studied by a multipurpose remote sensing and in situ payload in the
framework of the proposed orbiter mission.
 
Lower atmosphere and cloud layer (0-60km)
-----------------------------------------
 
Structure
---------
Previous studies showed that the temperature structure below 30 km is
quite constant all over the planet. However, the temperature
structure in the lower scale height is virtually unknown. Mapping the
regions of high elevation in sub-micron spectral 'windows' at the
nightside will determine the surface temperature as a function of
altitude (Meadows and Crisp (1996)). Assuming this is equal to the
near-surface air temperature, this will allow a determination of the
thermal profile and lapse rate in the 0-10 km range and an
investigation of its degree of static stability, constraining the
dynamics and turbulence in this region. The thermal structure above
35 km altitude will be obtained from radiooccultations with high
vertical resolution.

(i) is done by mapping the regions of high elevation in sub-micron
spectral windows at the nightside.
(ii) thermal structure above 35 km altitude by radioocculatations
with high vertical resolution.
 
Composition
-----------
The study of the lower atmosphere composition by means of
spectroscopy in the near IR transparency 'windows' is one of the main
goals of the Venus Express mission.
More specific objectives include abundance measurements of H2O, SO2,
COS, CO, H2O, HCl, and HF and their horizontal and vertical
(especially for H2O) variations:
a/ to significantly improve our understanding of the chemistry,
dynamics, and radiative balance of the lower atmosphere,
b/ to search for localized volcanic activity.
 
Cloud layer
-----------
Venus is shrouded by a 20 km thick cloud layer whose opacity varies
between 20 and 40 in the UV, visible and infrared. The clouds are
almost featureless in visible light but display prominent markings in
the UV-blue spectral region. Earlier observations showed that at
least the upper cloud consists of micron size droplets of 75% H2SO4,
which is produced by photochemical reactions at the cloud tops. The
physical and chemical processes forming the lower clouds are
virtually unknown, including major problems like (1) the nature of
the UV-blue absorber which produces the features observed from space
and absorbs half of the energy received by the planet from the Sun,
and (2) the origin of the large solid particles detected by the
Pioneer-Venus probe.
 
The remote sensing instruments on Venus Express will sound the
structure, composition, dynamics, and variability of the cloud layer,
including:
 
- Cloud and haze structure and opacity variations;
- Distribution and nature of the UV-blue absorber;
- Measurements of atmospheric composition which constrain models of
cloud formation and evolution.
 
Greenhouse effect
-----------------
The high surface temperature of about 735 K results from the powerful
greenhouse effect created by the presence of sulphuric acid clouds
and certain gases (CO2, H2O, SO2) in the atmosphere (see
[CRISP&TITOV1997]). Less than 10% of the incoming solar radiation
penetrates through the atmosphere and heats the surface, but thermal
radiation from the surface and lower atmosphere has a lower
probability of escape to space due to the strong absorption by gas
and clouds. The result is about 500K difference between the surface
temperature and that of the cloud tops, an absolute record among the
terrestrial planets.
 
The measurements of outgoing fluxes over a broad spectral range,
combined with temporarily and latitudinally resolved cloud mapping
and high resolution spectroscopy in the near IR windows will give an
insight into the roles of radiative and dynamical heat transport, and
the various species, in the greenhouse mechanism.
 
Atmospheric dynamics
--------------------
The dynamics of the lower atmosphere of Venus is mysterious. Previous
analysis showed that the atmosphere is involved in zonal retrograde
super-rotation with wind velocities decreasing from ~100 m/s at the
cloud tops to almost 0 at the surface. At the same time, there
appears to be a slower overturning of the atmosphere from equator to
pole, with giant vortices at each pole recycling the air downwards.
Additional questions include:
(1) whether the meridional circulation is one enormous 'Hadley' cell
extending from the upper atmosphere to the surface, or a stack of
such cells, or something else altogether;
(2) how the polar vortices couple the two main components of the
global circulation and why they have such a complex shape and
behaviour;
(3) what the observed (and observable) distributions of the minor
constituents in Venus'atmosphere, including the clouds, are telling
us about the motions
The Venus Express spacecraft orbiting every 10-15 hours and imaging
the poles both in the thermal infrared wavelengths, sensitive to the
emission from the cloud tops, and the near-IR 'windows', which probe
much deeper, will allow the production of time- and spatially-
resolved movies which would reveal much more information about the
behaviour of the Venusian polar vortices.
The Venus Express spacecraft will globally track the time and space
evolution of the clouds with precision over an extended period of
time.
 
Lightning
---------
The Venus clouds consist, at least in part, of sulphuric acid
particles, which have the ability to form highly charged droplets and
offer the potential of lightning. The nature and occurrence, and even
existence of lightning on Venus remains a topic of much debate
[GREBOWSKYETAL1997]. Resolving this debate with new data is important
both for understanding how the atmospheres of the terrestrial planets
become electrified and discharge and to determine if lightning is
important in the chemistry of the Venus atmosphere.
 
Venus Express will provide a long-term set of electromagnetic and
optical observations to determine the strength of the flashes and
their rates of occurrence, and hence to investigate the nature of
lightning on Venus.
 
Middle atmosphere (60-110 km)
-----------------------------
The Venera and Pioneer Venus orbiters observed this region in the UV
and thermal infrared, but with relatively poor coverage in spectral
range, latitudes and local solar time [LELLOUCHETAL1997].
 
Temperature
-----------
The temperature structure of the middle atmosphere shows significant
latitudinal variability which is probably driven by the dynamics but
remain poorly understood. Systematic monitoring of the upper
mesospheric (70-100 km) temperature field would help to unfold the
nature of cyclostrophic balance and the highly variable zonal winds
above the cloud tops.
 
Composition and chemistry
-------------------------
The mesosphere is the region where photochemical dissociation of CO2
and SO2 occurs, followed by cycles of carbon dioxide recombination
and formation of sulphuric acid. The mesospheric chemistry is
described by a chain of reactions that involves HOx, ClOx, SOx, and
Cx. H2O exhibit a remarkable variability in the mesosphere. Pioneer
Venus found a high concentration of water vapour in a localized
region in the mid-afternoon local time, perhaps due to a dynamical
phenomenon, in which convection driven by a local heating maximum
transports relatively moist air from beneath. A steady decline of SO2
from about 400 ppb to ~100 ppb at the cloud tops was observed to
occur between 1979 and 1989 [ESPOSITOETAL1997], possibly attributable
to a volcanic eruption at the end of the seventies. Also the SO2
mixing ratio seems to increase towards the poles.
The water vapour and sulfur dioxide should be studied in more detail
to understand both chemistry and dynamics of the mesosphere, as well
as the processes of cloud formation.
 
Dynamics
--------
The middle atmosphere is a transition region between the zonal
super-rotation regime in the lower atmosphere and solar-antisolar
circulation in the upper atmosphere, but how the transition occurs is
virtually unknown. The lower mesosphere is characterized by
deposition of significant amount of solar energy due to the presence
of unknown UV-blue absorber in the upper cloud (67-60 km). Tracking
the motions of the UV features from orbit is a powerful tool to study
the global circulation and wave phenomena in the lower mesosphere.
Mesospheric dynamics was also studied indirectly by Venera-15 and
Pioneer Venus orbiters that measured the 3-D temperature field with
subsequent derivation of zonal wind field assuming cyclostrophic
balance [LELLOUCHETAL1997, ESPOSITOETAL1997]. The zonal wind is
dominated by the strong midlatitude jet with speeds up to 150 m/s.
This jet located at ~50 N in the vicinity of the cloud tops shows
tidal variability. Two weaker jets were also identified at ~85 km and
~65 km.
 
The O2 airglow in the near IR (1.27 m) and visible ranges (0.4-0.8 m)
are formed from the recombination of atomic O produced on the dayside
from the CO2 photolysis at 100-120 km and transported to the night
side by the subsolar-to-antisolar flow. They nominally probe the
95-110 km region (IR airglow) and 100-130 km region (visible
airglow), and their intensities and spatial distributions are
strongly dependent on the mesospheric/ thermospheric circulation, and
specifically on the zonal wind profile, the Rayleigh friction
controlling the subsolar-to- antisolar flow, and the nightside eddy
diffusion coefficient.
 
The Venus Express orbiter will investigate the mesosphere by means of
global, simultaneous, and spatially resolved spectroscopic
observations ranging from UV to thermal IR and will:
- Study the wind and dynamic phenomena by tracking the motions of UV
cloud features;
- Measure the 3-D temperature and thermal wind fields;
- Study the abundance of SO2,SO, H2O,HCl, CO and other species;
Mapping the O2 infrared and visible airglow as dynamical tracer.
 
Upper atmosphere (110-200 km)
-----------------------------
 
Structure and composition
-------------------------
 
Our knowledge of the structure of Venus thermosphere remains
incomplete because:
(i) in-situ measurements provide limited spatial sampling
(ii) airglow features typically probe broad (15-20 km range) vertical
regions, i.e. have poor vertical resolution
(iii) most of the information is restricted to equatorial latitudes.
Thus, a global characterization of density and temperature structure
is still needed.
 
Dynamics
--------
The large day-to-night temperature (and corresponding pressure)
gradients in the thermosphere were expected to drive very strong
(nearly 400 m/s) subsolar-to-antisolar winds. However, from the
available data (neutral density and temperature contrasts, UV,
visible, and IR airglow maps), the global circulation of the Venus
upper atmosphere is inferred to be much weaker, and can be decomposed
into two distinct flow patterns :
(1) a generally stable subsolar-to- antisolar (SS-AS) circulation
cell driven mostly by solar EUV/UV heating
(2) an asymmetric retrograde superrotating zonal (RSZ) flow that
seems to vary greatly over time [BOUGHERETAL1997, KASPRZAKETAL1997].
 
The processes responsible for maintaining and driving variations in
the thermospheric winds are still not well understood or quantified.
It is apparent that some type of deceleration mechanism, perhaps the
breaking of upward propagating gravity waves, is necessary to slow
the upper atmospheric winds, but a viable gravity wave drag mechanism
must still be found.
 
Minor constituents with intermediate chemical and photochemical
lifetimes yield clues about the atmospheric dynamics at different
levels.
 
The 3D modeling tool used to examine the density, temperature,
airglow distribution is currently unable to reproduce the observed.
The modeling task would be much improved if simultaneous temperature,
density and wind measurements could be made above 100 km.
The key science problems related to the thermosphere are summarized
as follows:
(1). What are the processes responsible for maintaining (and driving
variations in) the subsolar-to-antisolar (symmetric) and
superrotating (asymmetric) global winds in the Venus upper
atmosphere?
(2). What is the self-consistent (unique) solution of the global
wind, temperature, and density variations of the Venus thermosphere?
 
Venus Express will address these questions by:
(i) Measurements of the atmospheric structure up to 180 km with high
vertical resolution from solar/stellar occultations, especially in
middle and high latitudes;
(ii) Mapping the airglows of O2, NO, O, and H as global circulation
tracers;
(iii) Studying the dynamical processes that link the middle and upper
atmosphere (tides, planetary and gravity waves, etc.)
 
Plasma environment and escape processes
---------------------------------------
 
The study of escape processes from the upper atmosphere has direct
implications for the origin and evolution of the Venus atmosphere.
How did the atmosphere evolve under the combined effects of escape
and interaction with the solid planet? The insignificant amount of
water is possibly explained by intense hydrogen escape at early
epochs. Similarly, the lack of molecular oxygen in the present Venus
atmosphere requires extremely strong escape in the past and/or
massive oxidation of surface material. Current understanding of these
processes based on relative abundance of noble gases and isotopic
ratios is rather poor.
 
Water: Hydrogen and Deuterium
-----------------------------
 
Venus Express will address the problems of atmospheric escape and
plasma environment by :
- in situ measurements of the energetic neutral atoms, ions,
electrons, and magnetic field and inference of escape rates;
- active radar sounding of the vertical structure of the topside
ionosphere;
- high-resolution spectroscopic observations of CO2 and H2O to derive
ratios of C, O, and H isotopes from the cloud tops up to ~200 km;
- Remote sounding of the solar wind turbulence.
 
Studies of the atmospheric escape via in situ measurements are
inherently limited by spatial coverage of a spacecraft and can be
performed only statistically. Only though global imaging techniques
such as ENA imaging by ASPERA, instantaneous observations of the
global distribution of the escaping plasma can be provided
[WILLIAMSETAL1992B].
 
Magnetic field measurements  will be helpful to interpret the in situ
plasma measurements and associated ionospheric structures below. The
investigation of vertical distribution of species in the exosphere
and plasma/magnetic field/ energetic neutral atoms environment near
Venus is very important in order to understand the evolution of
terrestrial atmospheres and to understand better what was the Earth's
environment during the epochs of weak magnetic field.
 
Surface and surface-atmosphere interaction
------------------------------------------
 
Geology
-------
The Magellan images surprisingly revealed that Venus is among the
most geologically active planets in the Solar System. Volcanic
activity and tectonics have strongly affected the Venusian surface
[SOLOMONETAL1992] forming highly deformed plateau (Tesserae) and large
lowlands (Planitiae).
Magellan raised new mysteries about the geological evolution of the
planet:
- What was the global geodynamic style within the last 0.5-1 b.y. of
the geologic history of this planet?
- Were the observed tectonic structures formed in global-wide pulses
with a specific strain environment or did tectonic resurfacing occur
in episodes more distributed in space and time?
- What are the volumes of old and recent volcanism?
- What were the rates of volcanism in different geologic epochs?
- Is there ongoing volcanic and tectonic activity?
- What is the true scale of exogenic processes controlling, at least
partly, surface microrelief?
These questions arise in part because Magellan and previous missions
could not determine the sub-surface relations of the geological
bodies due to using the frequencies that limited the measured
characteristics of the surface to certain scales. The Venus Express
radio science investigation VeRa meet these challenges and will
strongly complement the Magellan observations. The mission will
perform subsurface sounding of the Venusian landforms to:
1) outline the internal 3D geometry of tectonic and stratigraphic
relationships between geological bodies,
(2) provide new data on surface properties,
(3) provide new altimetry data complementing Magellan imagery.
 
Surface properties and surface-atmosphere interactions
------------------------------------------------------
 
The surface of Venus is geologically young and the presence of
sulphuric acid clouds together with the large abundance of SO2
suggests the possibility of current volcanic activity. Observations
in the sub-micron spectral 'windows' will search for regions of
volcanic activity through enhanced surface temperatures and possibly
enhanced gaseous absorption (SO2, H2O, HCl, for instance). Measuring
the abundance of these gases in the lower atmosphere will also
provide constrains on the models of the surface-atmosphere
interaction. In particular, reactive gases, such as HF and HCl, are
thought to be buffered by chemical assemblages on the Venusian
surface.
Monitoring the HCl abundance and searching for possible horizontal
variations through nightside observations at 1.7 m will permit to
check the effectiveness of this chemical buffering. If variations
were detected, they would point to dynamical effects associated with
unknown atmospheric chemistry and would thus have strong implications
on the halide chemistry and mineralogy.
Venus Express will significantly contribute to this problem by
providing high-resolution spectroscopic, spectro-imaging, and mapping
in the near-IR spectral windows.]]></field>

    ================
      The Hubble Space Telescope is a cooperative program of the European
      Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration (NASA) to operate a long-lived space-based
      observatory for the benefit of the international astronomical
      community. HST is an observatory first dreamt of in the 1940s,
      designed and built in the 1970s and 80s, and operational only in the
      1990s. Since its preliminary inception, HST was designed to be a
      different type of mission for NASA -- a permanent space-based
      observatory. To accomplish this goal and protect the spacecraft
      against instrument and equipment failures, NASA had always planned
      on regular servicing missions. Hubble has special grapple fixtures,
      76 handholds, and stabilized in all three axes. HST is a 2.4-meter
      reflecting telescope which was deployed in low-Earth orbit (600
      kilometers) by the crew of the space shuttle Discovery (STS-31) on
      25 April 1990.
 
      Responsibility for conducting and coordinating the science
      operations of the Hubble Space Telescope rests with the Space
      Telescope Science Institute (STScI) on the Johns Hopkins University
      Homewood Campus in Baltimore, Maryland. STScI is operated for NASA
      by the Association of University for Research in Astronomy,
      Incorporated (AURA).
 
      HST's current complement of science instruments include two cameras,
      two spectrographs, and fine guidance sensors (primarily used for
      astrometric observations). Because of HST's location above the
      Earth's atmosphere, these science instruments can produce high
      resolution images of astronomical objects. Ground-based telescopes
      can seldom provide resolution better than 1.0 arc-seconds, except
      momentarily under the very best observing conditions. HST's
      resolution is about 10 times better, or 0.1 arc-seconds.
 
      When originally planned in 1979, the Large Space Telescope program
      called for return to Earth, refurbishment, and relaunch every 5
      years, with on-orbit servicing every 2.5 years. Hardware lifetime
      and reliability requirements were based on that 2.5-year interval
      between servicing missions. In 1985, contamination and structural
      loading concerns associated with return to Earth aboard the shuttle
      eliminated the concept of ground return from the program. NASA
      decided that on-orbit servicing might be adequate to maintain HST
      for its 15-year design life. A three year cycle of on-orbit
      servicing was adopted. The first HST servicing mission in December
      1993 was an enormous success. Future servicing missions are
      tentatively planned for March 1997, mid-1999, and mid-2002.
      Contingency flights could still be added to the shuttle manifest to
      perform specific tasks that cannot wait for the next regularly
      scheduled servicing mission (and/or required tasks that were not
      completed on a given servicing mission).
 
      The years since the launch of HST in 1990 have been momentous, with
      the discovery of spherical aberration and the search for a practical
      solution. The STS-61 (Endeavour) mission of December 1993 fully
      obviated the effects of spherical aberration and fully restored the

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
    ================
      The Hubble Space Telescope is a cooperative program of the European
      Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration (NASA) to operate a long-lived space-based
      observatory for the benefit of the international astronomical
      community. HST is an observatory first dreamt of in the 1940s,
      designed and built in the 1970s and 80s, and operational only in the
      1990s. Since its preliminary inception, HST was designed to be a
      different type of mission for NASA -- a permanent space-based
      observatory. To accomplish this goal and protect the spacecraft
      against instrument and equipment failures, NASA had always planned
      on regular servicing missions. Hubble has special grapple fixtures,
      76 handholds, and stabilized in all three axes. HST is a 2.4-meter
      reflecting telescope which was deployed in low-Earth orbit (600
      kilometers) by the crew of the space shuttle Discovery (STS-31) on
      25 April 1990.
 
      Responsibility for conducting and coordinating the science
      operations of the Hubble Space Telescope rests with the Space
      Telescope Science Institute (STScI) on the Johns Hopkins University
      Homewood Campus in Baltimore, Maryland. STScI is operated for NASA
      by the Association of University for Research in Astronomy,
      Incorporated (AURA).
 
      HST's current complement of science instruments include two cameras,
      two spectrographs, and fine guidance sensors (primarily used for
      astrometric observations). Because of HST's location above the
      Earth's atmosphere, these science instruments can produce high
      resolution images of astronomical objects. Ground-based telescopes
      can seldom provide resolution better than 1.0 arc-seconds, except
      momentarily under the very best observing conditions. HST's
      resolution is about 10 times better, or 0.1 arc-seconds.
 
      When originally planned in 1979, the Large Space Telescope program
      called for return to Earth, refurbishment, and relaunch every 5
      years, with on-orbit servicing every 2.5 years. Hardware lifetime
      and reliability requirements were based on that 2.5-year interval
      between servicing missions. In 1985, contamination and structural
      loading concerns associated with return to Earth aboard the shuttle
      eliminated the concept of ground return from the program. NASA
      decided that on-orbit servicing might be adequate to maintain HST
      for its 15-year design life. A three year cycle of on-orbit
      servicing was adopted. The first HST servicing mission in December
      1993 was an enormous success. Future servicing missions are
      tentatively planned for March 1997, mid-1999, and mid-2002.
      Contingency flights could still be added to the shuttle manifest to
      perform specific tasks that cannot wait for the next regularly
      scheduled servicing mission (and/or required tasks that were not
      completed on a given servicing mission).
 
      The years since the launch of HST in 1990 have been momentous, with
      the discovery of spherical aberration and the search for a practical
      solution. The STS-61 (Endeavour) mission of December 1993 fully
      obviated the effects of spherical aberration and fully restored the
      functionality of HST.]]></field>

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
    Apollo 15 was launched on 6 July 1971 UT 13:34:00 on a Saturn V
    rocket from Kennedy Space Center.  Lunar orbit insertion took place
    on 29 July 1971 UT 20:05:47.  The Lunar Module (LM) landed on the
    Moon on 30 July 1971 UT 22:16:29, near the Hadley Rille and
    Apennine Mountains (26.13 N, 3.63 E), while the Command/Service
    Module (CSM) orbited the Moon.  The lunar ascent module launched
    from the Moon on 2 August 1971 UT 17:11:22.  The command module was
    returned to Earth on 7 August 1971 UT 20:45:53.
 
    The astronauts on Apollo 15 were commander David Scott, command
    module pilot Alfred Worden, and lunar module pilot James Irwin.
 
    Three excursions on the first Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) lasted a
    total of 18 hours and 35 minutes and traversed 27.9 km.  The lunar
    surface stay-time was 66.9 hours.  During the stay, the Apollo
    Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP) was placed and activated,
    and 77.31 kg of rock and soil samples were collected.  The duration
    of the lunar orbit was 145 hours for a total of 74 orbits.  The
    small sub-satellite was deployed from the CSM on 4 August 1972 UT
    20:13:19 and left in lunar orbit for the first time.
 
 
  Surface Operations
  ==================
    Scott and Irwin made three moonwalk extra-vehicular activities
    (EVAs) totaling 18 hours, 35 minutes.  During this time they covered
    27.9 km and collected 77.31 kg of rock and soil samples.  The LRV was
    used to explore regions within 5 km of the LM landing site.  This
    was the first time a vehicle of this type had been used, and its
    performance on the lunar terrain was very successful.  Two hours
    after landing the cabin was depressurized and Scott performed a
    standup EVA for 33 minutes, describing and photographing the
    surrounding terrain from the LM upper hatch.  The first moonwalk EVA
    was on 31 July from 13:13:10 UT to 19:45:59 UT, during which time
    the LRV was unloaded, deployed, and driven.  Photographs of the
    lunar surface were taken and geologic samples were collected from
    the LM site and during the three geological traverses.  The traverse
    on the first EVA covered 10.3 km to the edge of Hadley Rille to
    Elbow Crater and near St. George Crater and back to the LM, where a
    core sample was taken from three meters below the surface.  The
    ALSEP was deployed at the end of the traverse. On the second EVA,
    on 1 August from 11:48:48 UT to 19:01:02 UT, the LRV was driven on
    a 12.5 km traverse southeast along the base of the Apennine
    Mountains near Index, Arbeit, Crescent, Dune, and Spur craters and
    back to the ALSEP site.  On the third EVA on 2 August from 08:52:14
    UT to 13:42:04 UT the LRV was driven a total of 5.1 km west to
    Scarp Crater and northwest along the edge of Hadley Rille and back
    east across the mare.  The LM lifted off the Moon on 2 August at
    17:11:22 UT after 66 hours, 55 minutes on the lunar surface.
 
 
  Surface Experiments
  ===================
    The Apollo 15 astronauts performed and deployed many experiments on
    the lunar surface along with the geologic studies, sample return,
    and surface photography.
 
      - The Solar Wind Composition experiment collected samples of
        solar wind on a large piece of foil which was returned to
        Earth;
 
      - The Soil Mechanics Investigations studied the physical
        properties of the lunar regolith using observations recorded by
        video and audio and a surface penetrometer which recorded data
        on a drum which was returned to Earth.
 
    Other experiments were part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments
    Package (ALSEP) which was emplaced at the landing site by the
    astronauts.  The instruments, connected by cables to a central
    station which controlled power and communications, ran
    autonomously.  Data collected was converted to a telemetry format
    and transmitted to Earth.  Many of these experiments returned data
    until September 1977, when the ALSEP network was turned off due to
    budgetary constraints.
 
    The Apollo 15 ALSEP instruments consisted of:
 
      - A Passive Seismometer, designed to measure seismic activity and
        physical properties of the lunar crust and interior;
 
      - A Lunar Surface Magnetometer, designed to measure the magnetic
        field at the ALSEP site;
 
      - A Solar Wind Spectrometer, designed to measure protons and
        electrons from the solar wind and magnetotail plasma impinging
        on the lunar surface;
 
      - A Suprathermal Ion Detector. Designed to measure positive ions
        reaching the lunar surface to provide data on the plasma
        interaction between the solar wind and the Moon;
 
      - A Heat Flow Experiment, designed to measure the rate of heat loss
        from the lunar interior and the thermal properties of lunar
        material;
 
      - A Cold Cathode Ion Gage, designed to measure the density of
        neutral particles in the tenuous lunar atmosphere;
 
      - A Laser Ranging Retroreflector, designed to reflect laser pulses
        from Earth back to their point of origin to make accurate
        determination of the distance between Earth and the Moon;
 
      - A Lunar Dust Detector, designed to assess the long-term effects
        of the lunar dust, radiation, and thermal environment on solar
       cells.
 
 
  Orbital Science Experiments
  ===========================
    Investigations were also carried out from lunar orbit in the Apollo
    15 Command and Service Module.  Hand-held photography was performed
    from the command module, and a suite of instruments operated from
    the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) in the Service Module,
    comprising:
 
      - Metric and Panoramic cameras to take photographs of the lunar
        surface from orbit;
 
      - A Laser Altimeter using reflected laser pulses to profile the
        topography of lunar surface;
 
      - A Gamma-ray Spectrometer Experiment to measure gamma ray
        emissions from the lunar surface to determine composition;
 
      - An X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer Experiment to measure
        secondary X-ray emissions from the lunar surface to determine
        composition;
 
      - An Alpha Particle Spectrometer Experiment to measure radon gas
        emissions from the lunar surface;
 
      - An S-Band Transponder Experiment designed to carefully track
        the CSM orbit and measure the lunar gravity field;
 
      - An Orbital Mass Spectrometer Experiment to study the tenuous
        lunar atmosphere and search for active lunar volcanism;
 
      - A Bistatic Radar Experiment used measurements of S-Band and VHF
        reflections to probe electromagnetic and structural properties
        of the lunar surface;
 
      - A Subsatellite released from the CSM into lunar orbit with
        instruments to measure the Moon's gravity field, magnetic
        field, and distribution of charged particles.
 
    Additional experiments were also performed in lunar orbit and
    during the cruise between Earth and the Moon:
 
      - The Ultraviolet Photography Experiment took images of Earth
        and the Moon in UV;
 
      - The Gegenschein Photography Experiment took images of the
        reflections from dust particles at the Moulton point;
 
      - The Window Meteoroid experiment studied micrometeoroid impacts
        on the Apollo 15 Command Module heat shield windows to obtain
        information about the mass flux of micro-meteorites;]]></field>

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
    The Mars Pathfinder Project was one of the first of the NASA
    Discovery class missions.  Discovery Program missions are defined
    as low cost missions, (with a $150M FY'92 development cost cap),
    and a fast schedule (less than 3 years development period).  They
    have focused, but significant, science objectives.
 
    Mars Pathfinder placed a single vehicle on the surface of Mars,
    the Mars Pathfinder Lander, which then deployed a microrover,
    called variously 'Sojourner', the 'Microrover Flight Experiment',
    or the 'Mars Pathfinder Rover'.  Several instruments were
    included on the two spacecraft.  The Sojourner carried three
    cameras, (two black & white cameras on the front and one color
    camera in the rear), and the Alpha Proton X-Ray Spectrometer
    (APXS).  Sojourner's mobility provided the capability of 'ground
    truthing' a landing area over hundreds of square meters on Mars.
    The Lander investigated the surface of Mars with two additional
    science instruments, a stereoscopic imager with spectral filters
    on an extensible mast (Imager for Mars Pathfinder or IMP), and
    the Atmospheric Structure Instrument / Meteorology package
    (ASI/MET).  Mars Pathfinder paved the way for a cost effective
    implementation of future Mars lander missions as part of a
    comprehensive Mars exploration program augmented by additional
    Discovery Program missions.
 
    The launch occurred December 4, 1996 on a McDonnell Douglas Delta
    II 7925 launch vehicle.  The Earth-Mars trajectory was a Type 1
    transfer with a Mars arrival date of July 4, 1997.  The landing
    site for Mars Pathfinder was in the Ares Vallis region of Chryse
    Planitia at 19.17 degrees North latitude, 33.21 degrees West
    longitude.  (See [GOLOMBEKETAL1997B] or the DATASET.CAT file on
    this CD-ROM for specifics.) The Earth elevation angle at landing
    was 11 degrees and rising, and the Sun was 30 degrees below the
    local horizon and rising.  The Earth-Mars range at arrival was
    191,000,000 km (and increasing).
 
    Required guidance, navigation, attitude control, telemetry, and
    power generation functions during the 7 month cruise were
    provided by the cruise stage.  At Mars arrival, the cruise stage
    was jettisoned from the entry capsule.  The entry capsule entered
    the Martian atmosphere directly from the Earth-Mars transfer
    orbit at a velocity of 7.6 km/s.  The lander velocity was reduced
    from this high entry speed through the sequential application of
    aerodynamic braking by a Viking heritage aeroshell and parachute,
    propulsive deceleration using small solid tractor rockets, and
    airbags to nullify the remaining vertical and horizontal velocity
    components at surface impact.  Key engineering status information
    was collected and returned in near real time to the extent
    possible during entry and descent.  In addition, all engineering
    and science data obtained during the critical entry, descent, and
    landing phase were recorded for playback at the initiation of
    lander surface operations.
 
    The principle surface operations activities were return of
    engineering data characterizing the performance of the lander
    system in the Martian environment, return of science data
    obtained from the imaging, meteorology, and spectroscopy
    instruments, and operation of the rover to deploy instruments and
    conduct science and technology experiments.
 
    Seven mission phases, including the extended phase, were defined
    to describe the periods of activity during the mission.  Brief
    summaries of the activities in each phase are described below.
 
    The mission has been described in many papers including a
    February, 1997 special issue of the Journal of Geophysical
    Research and a December, 1997 special issue of Science.  Sometime
    in the latter half of 1998 there will be another special issue of
    the JGR discussing the results of the mission.
 
 
  Mission Phases
  ==============
 
    DEVELOPMENT
    -----------
      The development phase began with the start of mission funding
      in 1993.  During this phase, the science and technology
      requirements were analyzed and the spacecraft and its
      components were designed.  The instruments and spacecraft were
      fabricated and tested before delivery to the Eastern Test
      Range.  The spacecraft trajectory and mission operations were
      also determined during this period.

    PRELAUNCH
    ---------
      The prelaunch phase extended from delivery of the spacecraft to
      the Eastern Test Range (ETR) until initiation of the terminal
      countdown three hours prior to launch.  Principle activities
      performed during this phase included final assembly and
      checkout of the spacecraft, mating with the Payload Assist
      Module-D (PAM-D), propellant loading, and integration of the
      spacecraft/PAM-D stack on the Delta.  In addition, there was an
      extensive review cycle required prior to launch.

    LAUNCH
    ------
      The launch phase extended from the initiation of the terminal
      countdown through spacecraft separation from the upper stage.
      Mars Pathfinder was launched December 4, 1996, at 6:58 am UTC
      (1:58 am EST) from launch complex 17B at Cape Canaveral, FL.
      The launch azimuth was 95 degrees.  The boost portion of the
      launch vehicle trajectory took approximately 10 minutes.
      Injection occurred about one hour later after an extended coast
      phase.  After third stage burnout, the upper stage despun the
      stack using a yo-yo despin system.  Separation occurred
      approximately 75 minutes after launch.

    CRUISE
    ------
      The cruise phase started when the spacecraft separated from the
      upper stage and ended twelve hours prior to entry.  The cruise
      phase was subdivided into three subphases: near Earth,
      Earth-Mars transfer, and Mars approach.  The near Earth
      subphase started at separation and ended the day after the
      first Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM), which occurred on
      January 10, 1997.  Major activities performed in this subphase
      were initial link acquisition, initiation of the nominal cruise
      attitude profile, checkout of the spacecraft engineering
      functions, rover and instrument health checks, and TCM-1.  The
      Earth-Mars transfer subphase started at the end of the
      near-Earth subphase and extended through May 20, 1997 (45 days
      prior to arrival).  Activities carried out during this subphase
      included routine spacecraft health and performance monitoring,
      tracking data acquisition for navigation, and the second and
      third TCM's (performed on February 3 and May 7, respectively).
      The Mars approach subphase started on May 21, 1997 and ended
      twelve hours prior to entry on July 4, 1997.  TCM-4 (on June
      25), the entry attitude turn (where the spacecraft was placed
      into the desired entry attitude), and preparations for Mars
      atmospheric entry were completed during this subphase.
 
      Because the instruments were all enclosed within the folded-up
      lander, no science investigations were conducted during cruise,
      except for instrument health checkouts.

    ENTRY, DESCENT, AND LANDING
    ---------------------------
      The entry, descent and landing (EDL) phase of the mission
      started 12 hours prior to entry.  The spacecraft was in the
      autonomous EDL control mode during this period.  This phase
      ended when the airbags were fully retracted, the petals were
      deployed, and the lander transitioned from the EDL mode to
      sequence control.  This occurred 87 minutes after landing.  The
      EDL phase was divided into three subphases: entry, terminal
      descent, and EDL surface.
 
      The entry subphase extended from the start of the EDL phase
      through parachute deployment.  The exact time of parachute
      deployment was calculated from on-board accelerometer
      measurements, and occurred at 4:54:41 pm UTC (9:54:41 am PDT)
      on July 4, 1997.  Activities in this period included cruise
      stage separation, peak aerodynamic heating and deceleration,
      acquisition of engineering and science accelerometer data, and
      parachute deployment.
 
      The terminal descent subphase started at parachute deployment
      and ended when the lander rolled to a stop on the surface of
      Mars.  The landing occurred at 4:56:55 pm UTC (9:56:55 am PDT)
      July 4, 1997; the true local time at the landing site on Mars
      was 2:58 am.  The lander rolled for about two minutes before
      finally coming to rest about 12 miles southwest of its targeted
      landing spot.  It rested on the surface at a very slight tilt
      of about 2.5 degrees.  Heatshield separation, bridle
      deployment, radar altimeter data acquisition, airbag inflation,
      RAD (rocket assisted descent) motor ignition, and impact were
      the key activities of this subphase.
 
      The EDL surface subphase covered the time period required for
      the deflation and retraction of the airbags and deployment of
      the lander petals.  The spacecraft landed on its base petal,
      obviating the need for righting itself.  At 6:24 pm UTC (11:24
      am PDT), engineering data indicated that Pathfinder had fully
      deployed its petals and was awaiting sunrise on Mars to power
      up.

    LANDER SURFACE MISSION
    ----------------------
      Mars Pathfinder's surface, or primary, mission phase began when
      its lander petals were fully unfolded and the lander switched
      to a sequence of computer commands that controlled its
      functions.  This phase ended 30 Martian 'sols' (each sol being
      24.6 hours) after landing.  During this and the extended
      phases, a wealth of engineering and science information was
      collected from the lander and the instrument packages mounted
      on it.  The IMP camera alone acquired 16,661 images.

      Spacecraft Operations Type    : LANDER
 
 
    ROVER SURFACE MISSION
    ---------------------
      The Rover's primary mission lasted for seven Martian 'sols'
      from the time of landing.  One of the lander's airbags did not
      fully retract, and was initially draped over the edge of the
      rover's petal.  The petal had to be partially closed and then
      reopened.  This resulted in a slight delay in the deployment of
      the rover, which occurred at 5:37 am, July 6, 1997 UTC, (10:37
      pm, July 5, PDT).  During the Rover's primary and extended
      mission phases, the Rover traveled in a clockwise direction
      around the lander.  It acquired over 600 images and deployed
      the APXS instrument at a number of rock and soil sites.

      Spacecraft Operations Type    : ROVER
 
 
    LANDER EXTENDED MISSION
    -----------------------
      The Lander's extended mission ended with the last receipt of
      science data from the surface on September 27, 1997.  It is
      believed that a combination of a dead battery and the
      increasing cold of approaching Martian winter crippled the
      spacecraft's ability to communicate with Earth.

      Spacecraft Operations Type    : LANDER
 
 
    ROVER EXTENDED MISSION
    ----------------------
      The Sojourner rover was continuing to function at the time the
      Lander ceased communicating with Earth.  Upon loss of
      communication, the Rover presumably acted on its stored
      commands, which directed it to return to the Lander.

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
    The Mars Pathfinder Project was one of the first of the NASA
    Discovery class missions.  Discovery Program missions are defined
    as low cost missions, (with a $150M FY'92 development cost cap),
    and a fast schedule (less than 3 years development period).  They
    have focused, but significant, science objectives.
 
    Mars Pathfinder placed a single vehicle on the surface of Mars,
    the Mars Pathfinder Lander, which then deployed a microrover,
    called variously 'Sojourner', the 'Microrover Flight Experiment',
    or the 'Mars Pathfinder Rover'.  Several instruments were
    included on the two spacecraft.  The Sojourner carried three
    cameras, (two black & white cameras on the front and one color
    camera in the rear), and the Alpha Proton X-Ray Spectrometer
    (APXS).  Sojourner's mobility provided the capability of 'ground
    truthing' a landing area over hundreds of square meters on Mars.
    The Lander investigated the surface of Mars with two additional
    science instruments, a stereoscopic imager with spectral filters
    on an extensible mast (Imager for Mars Pathfinder or IMP), and
    the Atmospheric Structure Instrument / Meteorology package
    (ASI/MET).  Mars Pathfinder paved the way for a cost effective
    implementation of future Mars lander missions as part of a
    comprehensive Mars exploration program augmented by additional
    Discovery Program missions.
 
    The launch occurred December 4, 1996 on a McDonnell Douglas Delta
    II 7925 launch vehicle.  The Earth-Mars trajectory was a Type 1
    transfer with a Mars arrival date of July 4, 1997.  The landing
    site for Mars Pathfinder was in the Ares Vallis region of Chryse
    Planitia at 19.17 degrees North latitude, 33.21 degrees West
    longitude.  (See [GOLOMBEKETAL1997B] or the DATASET.CAT file on
    this CD-ROM for specifics.) The Earth elevation angle at landing
    was 11 degrees and rising, and the Sun was 30 degrees below the
    local horizon and rising.  The Earth-Mars range at arrival was
    191,000,000 km (and increasing).
 
    Required guidance, navigation, attitude control, telemetry, and
    power generation functions during the 7 month cruise were
    provided by the cruise stage.  At Mars arrival, the cruise stage
    was jettisoned from the entry capsule.  The entry capsule entered
    the Martian atmosphere directly from the Earth-Mars transfer
    orbit at a velocity of 7.6 km/s.  The lander velocity was reduced
    from this high entry speed through the sequential application of
    aerodynamic braking by a Viking heritage aeroshell and parachute,
    propulsive deceleration using small solid tractor rockets, and
    airbags to nullify the remaining vertical and horizontal velocity
    components at surface impact.  Key engineering status information
    was collected and returned in near real time to the extent
    possible during entry and descent.  In addition, all engineering
    and science data obtained during the critical entry, descent, and
    landing phase were recorded for playback at the initiation of
    lander surface operations.
 
    The principle surface operations activities were return of
    engineering data characterizing the performance of the lander
    system in the Martian environment, return of science data
    obtained from the imaging, meteorology, and spectroscopy
    instruments, and operation of the rover to deploy instruments and
    conduct science and technology experiments.
 
    Seven mission phases, including the extended phase, were defined
    to describe the periods of activity during the mission.  Brief
    summaries of the activities in each phase are described below.
 
    The mission has been described in many papers including a
    February, 1997 special issue of the Journal of Geophysical
    Research and a December, 1997 special issue of Science.  Sometime
    in the latter half of 1998 there will be another special issue of
    the JGR discussing the results of the mission.
 
 
  Mission Phases
  ==============
 
    DEVELOPMENT
    -----------
      The development phase began with the start of mission funding
      in 1993.  During this phase, the science and technology
      requirements were analyzed and the spacecraft and its
      components were designed.  The instruments and spacecraft were
      fabricated and tested before delivery to the Eastern Test
      Range.  The spacecraft trajectory and mission operations were
      also determined during this period.

    PRELAUNCH
    ---------
      The prelaunch phase extended from delivery of the spacecraft to
      the Eastern Test Range (ETR) until initiation of the terminal
      countdown three hours prior to launch.  Principle activities
      performed during this phase included final assembly and
      checkout of the spacecraft, mating with the Payload Assist
      Module-D (PAM-D), propellant loading, and integration of the
      spacecraft/PAM-D stack on the Delta.  In addition, there was an
      extensive review cycle required prior to launch.

    LAUNCH
    ------
      The launch phase extended from the initiation of the terminal
      countdown through spacecraft separation from the upper stage.
      Mars Pathfinder was launched December 4, 1996, at 6:58 am UTC
      (1:58 am EST) from launch complex 17B at Cape Canaveral, FL.
      The launch azimuth was 95 degrees.  The boost portion of the
      launch vehicle trajectory took approximately 10 minutes.
      Injection occurred about one hour later after an extended coast
      phase.  After third stage burnout, the upper stage despun the
      stack using a yo-yo despin system.  Separation occurred
      approximately 75 minutes after launch.

      Spacecraft Operations Type    : LANDER
 
 
    CRUISE
    ------
      The cruise phase started when the spacecraft separated from the
      upper stage and ended twelve hours prior to entry.  The cruise
      phase was subdivided into three subphases: near Earth,
      Earth-Mars transfer, and Mars approach.  The near Earth
      subphase started at separation and ended the day after the
      first Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM), which occurred on
      January 10, 1997.  Major activities performed in this subphase
      were initial link acquisition, initiation of the nominal cruise
      attitude profile, checkout of the spacecraft engineering
      functions, rover and instrument health checks, and TCM-1.  The
      Earth-Mars transfer subphase started at the end of the
      near-Earth subphase and extended through May 20, 1997 (45 days
      prior to arrival).  Activities carried out during this subphase
      included routine spacecraft health and performance monitoring,
      tracking data acquisition for navigation, and the second and
      third TCM's (performed on February 3 and May 7, respectively).
      The Mars approach subphase started on May 21, 1997 and ended
      twelve hours prior to entry on July 4, 1997.  TCM-4 (on June
      25), the entry attitude turn (where the spacecraft was placed
      into the desired entry attitude), and preparations for Mars
      atmospheric entry were completed during this subphase.
 
      Because the instruments were all enclosed within the folded-up
      lander, no science investigations were conducted during cruise,
      except for instrument health checkouts.

    ENTRY, DESCENT, AND LANDING
    ---------------------------
      The entry, descent and landing (EDL) phase of the mission
      started 12 hours prior to entry.  The spacecraft was in the
      autonomous EDL control mode during this period.  This phase
      ended when the airbags were fully retracted, the petals were
      deployed, and the lander transitioned from the EDL mode to
      sequence control.  This occurred 87 minutes after landing.  The
      EDL phase was divided into three subphases: entry, terminal
      descent, and EDL surface.
 
      The entry subphase extended from the start of the EDL phase
      through parachute deployment.  The exact time of parachute
      deployment was calculated from on-board accelerometer
      measurements, and occurred at 4:54:41 pm UTC (9:54:41 am PDT)
      on July 4, 1997.  Activities in this period included cruise
      stage separation, peak aerodynamic heating and deceleration,
      acquisition of engineering and science accelerometer data, and
      parachute deployment.
 
      The terminal descent subphase started at parachute deployment
      and ended when the lander rolled to a stop on the surface of
      Mars.  The landing occurred at 4:56:55 pm UTC (9:56:55 am PDT)
      July 4, 1997; the true local time at the landing site on Mars
      was 2:58 am.  The lander rolled for about two minutes before
      finally coming to rest about 12 miles southwest of its targeted
      landing spot.  It rested on the surface at a very slight tilt
      of about 2.5 degrees.  Heatshield separation, bridle
      deployment, radar altimeter data acquisition, airbag inflation,
      RAD (rocket assisted descent) motor ignition, and impact were
      the key activities of this subphase.
 
      The EDL surface subphase covered the time period required for
      the deflation and retraction of the airbags and deployment of
      the lander petals.  The spacecraft landed on its base petal,
      obviating the need for righting itself.  At 6:24 pm UTC (11:24
      am PDT), engineering data indicated that Pathfinder had fully
      deployed its petals and was awaiting sunrise on Mars to power
      up.

    ROVER SURFACE MISSION
    ---------------------
      The Rover's primary mission lasted for seven Martian 'sols'
      from the time of landing.  One of the lander's airbags did not
      fully retract, and was initially draped over the edge of the

      pm, July 5, PDT).  During the Rover's primary and extended
      mission phases, the Rover traveled in a clockwise direction
      around the lander.  It acquired over 600 images and deployed
      the APXS instrument at a number of rock and soil sites.

    LANDER EXTENDED MISSION
    -----------------------
      The Lander's extended mission ended with the last receipt of
      science data from the surface on September 27, 1997.  It is

    deliver a single flight system successfully to the Martian surface.
    This would demonstrate the entry, descent, and landing design by
    successfully acquiring and returning EDL engineering data and a
    panoramic image of the Martian surface.  The project had a number of
    secondary programmatic, engineering, science, and technology
    objectives which are listed below:
 
    Programmatic Objectives
 
    - Complete the development phase within a cost cap of $171M (real
      year) (excluding the rover)
    - Complete the mission operations and data analysis phase within a
      cost cap of $14M (real year) (excluding the rover)
    - Complete the development and operations of the rover within a cost
      cap of $25M (real year)
    - Establish management approaches and practices applicable for fixed
      price, quick reaction, low cost projects.
 
    Engineering Objectives
 
    - Demonstrate simple, reliable, low cost cruise, entry, descent, and
      landing systems.
    - Monitor and evaluate lander performance in the Martian
      environment.
    - Provide significant inheritance to future Mars lander missions.
    - Demonstrate the use of a rover surface vehicle as an instrument
      deployment and operation mechanism.
 
    Science Objectives
 
    - Obtain data on the structure of the Martian atmosphere along the
      entry and descent trajectory.
    - Characterize the landing site surface geology and morphology at
      sub-meter scale.
    - Monitor meteorological conditions at the landing site.
    - Investigate the elemental composition of rocks and surface
      materials at the landing site.
    - Constrain models of the interior of Mars by determining its rate
      of precession.
 
    Technology Objectives
 
    - Investigate Mars' terrain feature classes.
    - Investigate basic Martian soil mechanics parameters.
    - Assess the performance of dead reckoning navigation sensors and
      path reconstruction capabilities.
    - Investigate the sinkage of rover wheels in Martian soil.
    - Acquire all measurable rover engineering parameters during surface
      operations.
    - Monitor rover thermal behavior during surface operations.

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
    ================
      The mission was designed to have two spacecraft encounter Mars
      within a 5 day period, with TV images sent to Earth beginning
      2-3 days before closest approach.  Analysis of Mariner 6 data
      was required in time to reprogram Mariner 7.  Mariner 6 was
      targeted for a nearly equatorial flyby, with Mariner 7 taking a
      southerly route to enhance viewing of the south polar cap.  All
      original plans for data return volume were exceeded by
      substantial margins.  Refer to NASA SP-225 and other references
      for more information.  Mission start date given is for
      authorization given to JPL to proceed with the project.
 
 
    Mission Phases
    ==============
 
      MARINER 6 MARS ENCOUNTER
      ------------------------
        The encounter phase for Mariner 6 began with pointing of the
        scan platform at Mars, so that the planet sensor could track
        Mars for the narrow-angle TV camera.  All science instruments
        except the infrared spectrometer were activated at this time.
        Picture acquisition began 2 hours later.  The IR spectrometer
        filter motor and cooler were started at 35 min.  before
        closest approach.  The second Mars tracker viewed the Mars
        limb at -15 min., at 05:03 GMT July 31, starting the analog
        and digital tape recorders.  After closest approach, data
        playback continued for several days.

      Approximately 50 scientists from eight universities and three
      NASA centers participated in the Geologic Remote Sensing Field
      Experiment (GRSFE), which was co-sponsored by the NASA
      Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program and the NASA Geology
      Program.
 
      The GRSFE airborne campaign included data acquisition by
      several airborne instruments within a period of a few months,
      including the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging
      Spectrometer (AVIRIS; collected September 28, 29 and October 4,
      1989), Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS; collected
      July 17 and September 27 and 29, 1989), Advanced Solid-State
      Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS; July 17, 1989), and Polarimetric
      Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR; September 13 and 14, 1989).
      The sites covered were Lunar Crater Volcanic Field in Nevada,
      and a number of locations in the Mojave Desert of California.
 
      Field measurements were done at the time of the flights and
      were concentrated in the Lunar Lake area.  They included
      meteorological measurements using a Weather Station (WTHS) and
      wind speed towers (AWND), measurements using the Portable
      Apparatus for Rapid Acquisition of Bidirectional Observations
      of the Land and Atmosphere (PARABOLA), a spectral hygrometer
      (SHYG), and a Reagan radiometer (REAG).  Visible/near-infrared
      measurements were made using the Single Beam Visible/Infrared
      Intelligent Spectroradiometer (SIRIS), and a Daedalus
      Spectrafax AA440 field spectrometer (DAED).  Thermal spectral
      radiance measurements were made with the Portable Field
      Emission Spectrometer (PFES).  Surface temperatures were
      measured using a Raynger Raytek II Plus Radiometer (RMTR) and
      arrays of buried thermistors (THRM) and temperatures were made
      with these same instruments in a study of the directional
      character of emissivity from various surfaces.
 
      To assist in the calibration of the radar data, corner
      reflectors were deployed.  Stereo photography (from a
      helicopter, HSTP) was acquired, and topographic profiles were
      constructed.  Finally, GPS techniques were also used to extract
      topographic profiles.  Archive release version 1.0 of GRSFE
      consists of a set of 9 CD-ROMs.  Complete, detailed
      descriptions of the experiment, the sites over which data were
      acquired, data processing procedures, and data file formats are

    ================
      In the late 1970s it was realised that the return of Halley's
      comet in 1985/86 would provide a unique opportunity to combine a
      mission to explore Venus, (which had already been planned) with
      a mission to Halley by employing a two-element space vehicle
      consisting of a Venus lander (and balloon) and a Halley flyby
      probe.  The mission was called Vega, a contraction of the
      Russian words `Venera' (Venus) and `Gallei' (Halley) and was
      conducted by the USSR with a number of other countries within
      the framework of Intercosmos.
 
      The Vega mission comprised two identical spacecraft, Vega 1 and
      Vega 2.  This was a standard approach in the USSR, aimed
      primarily at increasing the overall reliability of the mission.
      In addition, if both flybys were successful there would be a
      significant increase in the scientific return, which was
      particularly valuable in the case of the Halley flybys
      considering the variability of the cometary activity.
 
      The Vega project was truly international.  While the spacecraft
      themselves were controlled by Soviet agencies, the scientific
      programme and payload were coordinated by the International
      Science and Technical Committee (CIST), representing scientific
      institutions and space agencies from nine countries.  The CIST
      designed the Vega mission to be complementary to the European
      Giotto and the Japanese Suisei cometary missions.
 
      The two spacecraft were launched by Proton rockets from the
      cosmoport Baikonur on 15 and 21 December 1984, respectively.  On
      11 and 15 June 1985, the two spacecraft successfully delivered
      the first balloons into the Venus atmosphere.  After deltaV-
      Venus gravity assist flybys, Vega 1 and Vega 2 encountered comet
      Halley on 6 and 9 March 1986, respectively.
 
      The interplanetary orbit of Vega 1 from launch to Halley flyby
      was entirely in the ecliptic.  The orbit of Vega 2 was almost
      identical except for slightly different flyby dates.  The plane
      of Halley's orbit was inclined at 17.8 degrees with respect to
      the ecliptic. Halley was above the ecliptic from the ascending
      to the descending node. The flyby speeds were extremely high
      because Halley's orbit sense was retrograde, that is, directed
      opposite to that of the Earth and thus of the spacecraft.
      During the encounter dust particles impacted on the spacecraft
      at ~ 80 km/s and caused damage to some experiments and the
      unprotected solar panels.
 
      The flight operations centre was located in Evpatoria (Crimea),
      but during the flybys most investigators were in Moscow at the
      Space Research Institute, where they were able to obtain all the
      data in real time.  Deep space antennas in Evpatoria (70 m) and
      Medvezy Ozera (64m), near Moscow, received the telemetry.
 
      During the cruise phase the pointing platform was clamped.  The
      clamping mechanism was released on Vega 1 on 14 February 1986
      and on Vega 2 on 18 February 1986, and the operation of the TVS
      and the pointing platform was checked by observing Jupiter and
      Saturn.  The cameras were found to be fully functional.  Two
      days before the Halley encounters the cameras were oriented
      towards Halley and switched on for two hours.  At last, on 6
      March 1986, a few minutes before 7:20 UT, for the first time in
      the history of mankind, the nucleus of comet Halley unveiled
      itself to the human eye.
 
      The second encounter took place almost exactly three days later.
      (The most important parameters of both flybys are summarised in
      the Table below.)

      Vega mission operations were discontinued a few weeks after the
      encounters.  The general condition of the spacecraft would have
      allowed further operation.  The solar panels were partially
      damaged by dust impact but could still have provided enough
      power.  The camera performance was tested by observing Jupiter
      and no essential degradation was registered.  Even the amount of
      fuel onboard was considerable.  However, after extensive
      searches and debates, no interesting object was identified for a
      possible second encounter.

<field name="investigation_objectives_summary"><![CDATA[Mission Objectives Overview
 ===========================
    One of the Vega program's aims was the exploration of Comet
    Halley. The scientific objectives of the Vega cometary
    investigation are:
 
 (i)  determination of the physical parameters of the
      nucleus: dimensions, shape, temperature and
      surface properties
 
 (ii) study of the structure and dynamics of the coma
      around the nucleus
 
 (iii)  definition of the gas composition in the close
      vicinity of the nucleus and the nature of the
      parent molecules
 
 (iv)  study of the dust particles' composition and
      mass distribution as functions of the distance
      to the nucleus, and
 
 (v)  study of the interaction of the solar wind with
      the atmosphere and ionosphere of the comet.
 
 The Vega mission to Halley's comet was not only scientifically highly
 successful, it also helped to forge international cooperation in
 space science at an unprecedented level, both within the Vega Project
 and in the worldwide cooperation with the other major space
 organisations. In fact, it led to the formation of the Inter-Agency
 Consultative Group for Space Science (IACG) which from 1981-86
 coordinated the six Halley space missions from its four member
 agencies: Intercosmos, NASA, ESA, and the Japanese ISAS. Since 1986
 the IACG has been coordinating a number of projects from the four
 space agencies in solar-terrestrial science.
 
 The in-situ observations by the various experiments onboard the flyby
 spacecraft were complemented by a large number of remote observations
 from space and from the ground, the latter being coordinated by the
 International Halley  Watch  (IHW).  The  IACG and  its counterpart
 on the ground, the IHW, formed the cornerstones of a global effort to
 explore Halley's comet as completely as possible during its 1985/86
 apparition. By the end of the 1980's when Halley disappeared again
 into the outer Solar System, it was the most thoroughly studied comet
 ever with more data having been collected on it than on all other
 comets put together.  The cameras onboard the Vega spacecraft made
 the most important observation of all: the discovery of the nucleus
 of comet Halley.]]></field>

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
 
  The Hayabusa spacecraft was successfully launched atop a Japanese M-V
  launch vehicle on May 9, 2003.  The mission plan was to have the
  spacecraft briefly alight upon the surface of near-Earth asteroid 25143
  Itokawa, fire pellets into the surface, collect the surface material
  ejecta and bring these surface samples back to Earth for intensive study.
  Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) and NASA
  agreed to cooperate on the Hayabusa (aka MUSES-C) mission.  Before
  launch, the mission name was MUSES-C, which stood for Mu Space
  Engineering Spacecraft, a space engineering spacecraft launched by a Mu
  rocket developed by ISAS, with C referring to it being the third in the
  series.  Just after launch, the mission was renamed Hayabusa (Japanese
  for falcon).
 
 
  Science Goals
  =============
 
  The overall science goal of the mission was to significantly advance
  our understanding of Earth's closest neighbors, the near-Earth asteroids.
  Some of these objects continue to pass closer to the Earth than the moon
  itself.  They represent the left over building blocks of the inner solar
  system formation process some 4.6 billion years ago and if we wish to
  understand the chemical mix from which the inner planets, including
  Earth, formed then the study of near-Earth asteroids is key.  Most
  objects in the inner portion of the asteroid belt have similar spectral
  characteristics.  These asteroids, including Itokawa, are so-called
  S-type objects that are rich in the minerals olivine and pyroxene.  By
  carrying out a detailed elemental composition of the surface samples,
  scientists will thereafter know the likely composition of existing, and
  newly discovered, S-type asteroids.  Asteroid compositions run the gamut
  from carbon-rich fragile structures, to fractured silicate rock and
  slabs of solid iron.  These objects will need to be studied to determine
  which among them are the most accessible to spacecraft and which are the
  richest in mineral wealth.  Another reason for investigating near-Earth
  asteroids is to understand their compositions and structures to
  successfully deflect an object that is found on an Earth threatening
  trajectory.
 
 
  Technology Goals
  ================
 
  Technology tests: Although the science return to date from the Hayabusa
  mission is rich, the mission's main goals are not scientific but rather
  the testing of four new technologies including 1.) a demonstration of
  the four ion engines in interplanetary space for up to 18,000 hours
  2.) use of the on board camera systems to autonomously guide the
  spacecraft during the asteroid rendezvous 3.) a demonstration of a
  sample collection device for retrieval of surface materials
  4.) a demonstration of the sample capsule's ability to carry out an
  Earth atmosphere entry direct from an interplanetary trajectory.
 
  Although there are four ion engines onboard the Hayabusa spacecraft,
  up to three of them operate simultaneously.  The fourth is a backup
  engine.  These ion engines operate when xenon fuel is first ionized via
  a microwave device.  The resulting xenon positive ions are then
  accelerated across a charged high voltage grid (providing the thrust)
  and finally a stream of electrons is used to neutralize the accelerated
  xenon ions.  Even when all three ion engines are operating full bore,
  they are only capable of accelerating the spacecraft to a very modest
  12 meters per second per day.  The force they generate is 20,000 times
  less than a traditional spacecraft thruster that burns chemical fuel
  (e.g., hydrazine).  However, while chemical thrusters operate for only
  a few seconds, these ion engines thrust continuously over many months
  and by so doing, they are capable of pushing the spacecraft to its
  September 2005 rendezvous with Itokawa.
 
  This is the first flight of a spacecraft with these advanced ion
  engines, the first attempt at a touch and go, autonomous landing on an
  asteroid's surface, and the first attempt of an asteroid surface sample
  return to Earth.
 
  Reaction Wheel Failure
  ======================
 
  To maintain spacecraft attitude, the Hayabusa spacecraft was equipped
  with three momentum wheels mounted in three orthogonal directions and
  hydrazine attitude control thrusters on the corners of the spacecraft.
  In late July 2005, one of the reaction wheels failed and a second wheel
  failed in early October 2005.  That left only the z-axis reaction wheel
  operational for the remainder of the mission.  The spacecraft made an
  unplanned surface landing November 20 and a planned touchdown 5 days
  later.  Just after lifting off from the surface the second time, the
  hydrazine attitude fuel was exhausted as it leaked into space causing a
  spin up of the spacecraft.  Radio contact with the spacecraft was lost
  on December 8, 2005 and a signal restored on January 23, 2006.  With
  communications re-established, the cold xenon gas jets from the canted
  neutralizers were used to restore attitude control by firing the
  neutralizer gas at specific times during the spacecraft spin cycle.  The
  high data rate was restored on February 25, 2006.  After the April 25,
  2006 departure from Itokawa, the Hayabusa spacecraft maintained attitude
  control via a careful balancing of the effects from the single
  operational momentum wheel, vectoring of the ion engines and the
  radiation pressure acting upon the solar panels. [KUNINAKAETAL2007]
 
  Instruments
  ===========
 
  Using three of the four ion engines at a time, Hayabusa flew past the
  Earth on May 19, 2004 to boost its velocity.  The spacecraft then caught
  up to the target asteroid in September 2005, a potato shaped near-Earth
  object named 25143 Itokawa, after the Japanese rocket pioneer, Hideo
  Itokawa (1912 - 1999).  During the three month operations period
  (September - November), the Hayabusa science instruments were designed
  to undertake an intensive study of the asteroid's surface.  These
  instruments are the science camera (AMICA); the surface hopper (MINERVA);
  the near infrared and x-ray spectrometers (NIRS, XRS); the Lidar
  altimeter (LIDAR); and the sample collection and return systems.
 
  AMICA: The Asteroid Multiband Imaging Camera was used to map the
  entire portion of the asteroid's surface that is observable in sunlight.
  The asteroid's size, shape, volume, and rotation characteristics were
  determined and a (negative) search was carried out for any neighboring
  satellites or dust rings that may have been closely orbiting Itokawa.
  Making observations with a set of colored filters (see Table 1),
  AMICA looked for slight differences in color over the asteroid's surface
  - color differences that might indicate changes in mineralogical
  composition.  The AMICA images will also be used to determine the optical
  properties of the surface materials at image resolutions well below one
  meter, provide constraints upon the surface particle sizes, and reveal
  the history of impacts from other asteroids or comets.  Results from the
  AMICA instrument are reported in [SAITOETAL2006].  A description of the
  AMICA instrument and its calibration is provided in [ISHIGUROETAL2010].

  WIDE         650                     300
 
  MINERVA:  Japanese engineers developed a surface hopper that could take
  close up images and thermal measurements of the asteroid's surface
  during, and in between, 10-meter hops about the surface.  About the size
  of a small can, the MINERVA hopper had six sun sensors (photodiodes) and
  an electric turntable that was designed to first orient the tiny
  spacecraft toward the sun thus allowing its solar panels to power it up.
  Once oriented properly, the thermal sensors were designed to determine
  Itokawa's surface temperature and then a rotating torque wheel would have
  spun within MINERVA causing the outside of the tiny spacecraft to counter
  rotate, dig into the surface and hop about 10 meters.  Once a hop was
  complete, additional surface temperature measurements would have been
  made and two of the three onboard cameras would have taken very
  high-resolution surface images in stereo.  The third camera, with a
  longer focal length than the other two, was designed to image the
  asteroid's surface while MINERVA was above the surface during mid-hop.
  Provided the Hayabusa spacecraft was within 20 kilometers, MINERVA's
  images and temperature data could have been radioed to the Hayabusa
  spacecraft and then relayed back to Earth.  It was designed to last
  three asteroid days or 36 hours.  MINERVA's final weight was 591 g and
  its diameter and height were 12 and 10 cm respectively.  Its three
  cameras (320 x 240 px) had adjustable shutter speeds.  The data rate was
  9.6 Kbits/s but due to the spacecraft's slight velocity away from the
  asteroid, MINERVA entered into a solar orbit rather than descending to the
  asteroid's surface. No asteroid data were received from this instrument.
  A description of the MINERVA lander is reported in [YOSHIMITSUETAL1999].
 
  NIRS and X-Ray Spectrometers: The on board, near infrared spectrometer
  examined the asteroid's spectral features in the near infrared region
  of the spectrum.  Whereas the near-infrared spectrometer relied upon
  meteorite analogs to identify the surface minerals of Itokawa, the x-ray
  spectrometer measured the elemental composition of these minerals
  directly.  Solar x-rays excite the individual elements of the asteroid's
  surface minerals and the resulting x-ray spectral features were
  identified and measured by the on board x-ray spectrometer.  Some of the
  expected elements include iron, silicon, manganese, calcium, aluminum and
  sodium.  By noting the relative abundances of these elements in the
  asteroid's surface minerals and comparing these abundances to those
  measured in various types of meteorites on Earth, a link can be forged
  between the composition of this type of rocky asteroid and the meteorites
  on Earth that likely represent the collision fragments of such asteroids.
  Thereafter, the composition can be inferred for newly discovered
  asteroids that are spectrally similar to the large group of S-type
  asteroids like Itokawa.  Results from the NIRS and X-Ray Spectrometer
  instruments are reported in [ABEETAL2006], [KITAZATOETAL2008],
  [OKADAETAL2006].
 
  LIDAR:  The LIDAR instrument measures the round-trip time of flight of
  infrared laser pulses transmitted from the Hayabusa spacecraft to the
  surface of Itokawa. The instrument operates in a single autonomous mode,
  in which it produces ranging measurements.  Surface topography estimates
  can be derived from these data, given appropriate corrections for the
  position and attitude of the spacecraft.  The principal components of
  LIDAR are a diode-pumped, Nd:YAG laser transmitter that emits 1.064
  micrometer wavelength laser pulses, a 0.126 m diameter telescope, a
  silicon avalanche photodiode detector, and a time interval unit with 14
  nsec resolution. During the long Home Position phase (~7km from Itokawa)
  of the misson, LIDAR provides measurements of the topography of Itokawa
  within approximately 12x4.9 m footprints.  Results from the LIDAR
  instrument are reported in [MUKAIETAL2007].
 
  Sample Collection and Return to Earth: The definitive work on this
  asteroid's composition will be done in Earth-based laboratories after the
  Hayabusa spacecraft returned its precious samples in June 2010.  After
  several weeks during which an initial mapping and reconnaissance phase
  was undertaken, the Hayabusa spacecraft was designed to descend to the
  surface of the asteroid, fire a 5 gram pellet of Tantalum into the
  asteroid's surface and immediately collect and store the resulting
  ejecta.  Tantalum, a rare non-corrosive metal, is used because it is
  very resistance to change and any tantalum found in the collected sample
  will be easily identified. This sampling maneuver could be done up to
  three times.  Because the light travel time between the asteroid and
  Earth was about 18 minutes at the time of the sampling, the spacecraft
  must act without human intervention.  As described below, there was no
  evidence that these pellets were successfully fired but the spacecraft
  did land upon the asteroid's surface so that some surface material was
  disturbed to an extent that allowed some of it to enter the
  sample collection chamber.  The landing attempts are outlined in
  [YANOETAL2006].
 
  On April 25, 2007, the Hayabusa spacecraft departed from the asteroid
  and in June of 2010, the spacecraft approached Earth and ejected the
  small (40 centimeters diameter) aluminum sample return capsule.  The
  sample container entered the Earth's atmosphere at about 12 kilometers
  per second, using ablative shielding to withstand the intense heat
  generated by atmospheric friction, and eventually parachuted down to the
  ground near Woomera Australia.  Eager scientists then collected the
  capsule and took it back to Japan so the asteroid surface samples could be
  carefully removed and distributed to the scientific community for study.
  These sample studies will be carried out using a variety of composition
  measuring devices in Earth based laboratories - devices that are not
  limited to the modest mass, volume, power, and data rates that can be
  accommodated by the Hayabusa spacecraft.  Furthermore, as more advanced
  future instrumentation is developed and new hypotheses arise, archived
  samples from the asteroid will be available for new measurements.
  Preliminary ground-based sample analyses were reported by
  [NAKAMURAETAL2011], [EBIHARAETAL2011], [YURIMOTOETAL2011],
  [NOGUCHIETAL2011],[TSUCHIYAMAETAL2011], and [NAGAOETAL2011]

  Leader (TL), are summarized below:

  Target Asteroid
  ===============
 
  Asteroid 25143 Itokawa:  The orbit of the Hayabusa target body, 25143
  Itokawa, has a low inclination with respect to the Earth's orbital plane
  (1.7 deg.) so it is one of the more accessible asteroids for a
  spacecraft rendezvous.  Fortunately, this asteroid made a close Earth
  approach to within six million kilometers in late March 2001 and an even
  closer Earth approach to within 2 million kilometers in late June 2004.
  Optical, infrared, and radar observations were undertaken in 2001 and
  2004.  The ground-based radar observations indicated that the object has
  a potato shape of approximate dimensions 548 x 312 x 276 meters
  [OSTROETAL2004] while ground-based optical and infrared data suggest
  that Itokawa is an S-type asteroid with a composition analogous to
  either an LL ordinary chondrite, or a primitive achondrite meteorite
  [BINZELETAL2001], [SEKIGUICHIETAL2001], [ABELLETAL2007].  In either case
  the asteroid appeared to be largely a silicate rock with a relatively
  low abundance of iron.  Detailed spectral observations obtained by the
  Hayabusa spacecraft were not able to definitively rule out either
  compositional interpretation [ABEETAL2006]. The spacecraft imaging
  confirmed the general dimensions of the asteroid.  Tables 2 and 3
  provide the orbital and physical characteristics for near-Earth asteroid
  25143 Itokawa as reported in [FUJIWARAETAL2006], [DEMURAETAL2006].

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
 
  The Hayabusa spacecraft was successfully launched atop a Japanese M-V
  launch vehicle on May 9, 2003.  The mission plan was to have the
  spacecraft briefly alight upon the surface of near-Earth asteroid 25143
  Itokawa, fire pellets into the surface, collect the surface material
  ejecta and bring these surface samples back to Earth for intensive study.
  Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) and NASA
  agreed to cooperate on the Hayabusa (aka MUSES-C) mission.  Before
  launch, the mission name was MUSES-C, which stood for Mu Space
  Engineering Spacecraft, a space engineering spacecraft launched by a Mu
  rocket developed by ISAS, with C referring to it being the third in the
  series.  Just after launch, the mission was renamed Hayabusa (Japanese
  for falcon).
 
 
  Science Goals
  =============
 
  The overall science goal of the mission was to significantly advance
  our understanding of Earth's closest neighbors, the near-Earth asteroids.
  Some of these objects continue to pass closer to the Earth than the moon
  itself.  They represent the left over building blocks of the inner solar
  system formation process some 4.6 billion years ago and if we wish to
  understand the chemical mix from which the inner planets, including
  Earth, formed then the study of near-Earth asteroids is key.  Most
  objects in the inner portion of the asteroid belt have similar spectral
  characteristics.  These asteroids, including Itokawa, are so-called
  S-type objects that are rich in the minerals olivine and pyroxene.  By
  carrying out a detailed elemental composition of the surface samples,
  scientists will thereafter know the likely composition of existing, and
  newly discovered, S-type asteroids.  Asteroid compositions run the gamut
  from carbon-rich fragile structures, to fractured silicate rock and
  slabs of solid iron.  These objects will need to be studied to determine
  which among them are the most accessible to spacecraft and which are the
  richest in mineral wealth.  Another reason for investigating near-Earth
  asteroids is to understand their compositions and structures to
  successfully deflect an object that is found on an Earth threatening
  trajectory.
 
 
  Technology Goals
  ================
 
  Technology tests: Although the science return to date from the Hayabusa
  mission is rich, the mission's main goals are not scientific but rather
  the testing of four new technologies including 1.) a demonstration of
  the four ion engines in interplanetary space for up to 18,000 hours
  2.) use of the on board camera systems to autonomously guide the
  spacecraft during the asteroid rendezvous 3.) a demonstration of a
  sample collection device for retrieval of surface materials
  4.) a demonstration of the sample capsule's ability to carry out an
  Earth atmosphere entry direct from an interplanetary trajectory.
 
  Although there are four ion engines onboard the Hayabusa spacecraft,
  up to three of them operate simultaneously.  The fourth is a backup
  engine.  These ion engines operate when xenon fuel is first ionized via
  a microwave device.  The resulting xenon positive ions are then
  accelerated across a charged high voltage grid (providing the thrust)
  and finally a stream of electrons is used to neutralize the accelerated
  xenon ions.  Even when all three ion engines are operating full bore,
  they are only capable of accelerating the spacecraft to a very modest
  12 meters per second per day.  The force they generate is 20,000 times
  less than a traditional spacecraft thruster that burns chemical fuel
  (e.g., hydrazine).  However, while chemical thrusters operate for only
  a few seconds, these ion engines thrust continuously over many months
  and by so doing, they are capable of pushing the spacecraft to its
  September 2005 rendezvous with Itokawa.
 
  This is the first flight of a spacecraft with these advanced ion
  engines, the first attempt at a touch and go, autonomous landing on an
  asteroid's surface, and the first attempt of an asteroid surface sample
  return to Earth.
 
  Reaction Wheel Failure
  ======================
 
  To maintain spacecraft attitude, the Hayabusa spacecraft was equipped
  with three momentum wheels mounted in three orthogonal directions and
  hydrazine attitude control thrusters on the corners of the spacecraft.
  In late July 2005, one of the reaction wheels failed and a second wheel
  failed in early October 2005.  That left only the z-axis reaction wheel
  operational for the remainder of the mission.  The spacecraft made an
  unplanned surface landing November 20 and a planned touchdown 5 days
  later.  Just after lifting off from the surface the second time, the
  hydrazine attitude fuel was exhausted as it leaked into space causing a
  spin up of the spacecraft.  Radio contact with the spacecraft was lost
  on December 8, 2005 and a signal restored on January 23, 2006.  With
  communications re-established, the cold xenon gas jets from the canted
  neutralizers were used to restore attitude control by firing the
  neutralizer gas at specific times during the spacecraft spin cycle.  The
  high data rate was restored on February 25, 2006.  After the April 25,
  2006 departure from Itokawa, the Hayabusa spacecraft maintained attitude
  control via a careful balancing of the effects from the single
  operational momentum wheel, vectoring of the ion engines and the
  radiation pressure acting upon the solar panels. [KUNINAKAETAL2007]
 
  Instruments
  ===========
 
  Using three of the four ion engines at a time, Hayabusa flew past the
  Earth on May 19, 2004 to boost its velocity.  The spacecraft then caught
  up to the target asteroid in September 2005, a potato shaped near-Earth
  object named 25143 Itokawa, after the Japanese rocket pioneer, Hideo
  Itokawa (1912 - 1999).  During the three month operations period
  (September - November), the Hayabusa science instruments were designed
  to undertake an intensive study of the asteroid's surface.  These
  instruments are the science camera (AMICA); the surface hopper (MINERVA);
  the near infrared and x-ray spectrometers (NIRS, XRS); the Lidar
  altimeter (LIDAR); and the sample collection and return systems.
 
  AMICA: The Asteroid Multiband Imaging Camera was used to map the
  entire portion of the asteroid's surface that is observable in sunlight.
  The asteroid's size, shape, volume, and rotation characteristics were
  determined and a (negative) search was carried out for any neighboring
  satellites or dust rings that may have been closely orbiting Itokawa.
  Making observations with a set of colored filters (see Table 1),
  AMICA looked for slight differences in color over the asteroid's surface
  - color differences that might indicate changes in mineralogical
  composition.  The AMICA images will also be used to determine the optical
  properties of the surface materials at image resolutions well below one
  meter, provide constraints upon the surface particle sizes, and reveal
  the history of impacts from other asteroids or comets.  Results from the
  AMICA instrument are reported in [SAITOETAL2006].  A description of the
  AMICA instrument and its calibration is provided in [ISHIGUROETAL2010].

  MINERVA:  Japanese engineers developed a surface hopper that could take
  close up images and thermal measurements of the asteroid's surface
  during, and in between, 10-meter hops about the surface.  About the size
  of a small can, the MINERVA hopper had six sun sensors (photodiodes) and
  an electric turntable that was designed to first orient the tiny
  spacecraft toward the sun thus allowing its solar panels to power it up.
  Once oriented properly, the thermal sensors were designed to determine
  Itokawa's surface temperature and then a rotating torque wheel would have
  spun within MINERVA causing the outside of the tiny spacecraft to counter
  rotate, dig into the surface and hop about 10 meters.  Once a hop was
  complete, additional surface temperature measurements would have been
  made and two of the three onboard cameras would have taken very
  high-resolution surface images in stereo.  The third camera, with a
  longer focal length than the other two, was designed to image the
  asteroid's surface while MINERVA was above the surface during mid-hop.
  Provided the Hayabusa spacecraft was within 20 kilometers, MINERVA's
  images and temperature data could have been radioed to the Hayabusa
  spacecraft and then relayed back to Earth.  It was designed to last
  three asteroid days or 36 hours.  MINERVA's final weight was 591 g and
  its diameter and height were 12 and 10 cm respectively.  Its three
  cameras (320 x 240 px) had adjustable shutter speeds.  The data rate was
  9.6 Kbits/s but due to the spacecraft's slight velocity away from the
  asteroid, MINERVA entered into a solar orbit rather than descending to the
  asteroid's surface. No asteroid data were received from this instrument.
  A description of the MINERVA lander is reported in [YOSHIMITSUETAL1999].
 
  NIRS and X-Ray Spectrometers: The on board, near infrared spectrometer
  examined the asteroid's spectral features in the near infrared region
  of the spectrum.  Whereas the near-infrared spectrometer relied upon
  meteorite analogs to identify the surface minerals of Itokawa, the x-ray
  spectrometer measured the elemental composition of these minerals
  directly.  Solar x-rays excite the individual elements of the asteroid's
  surface minerals and the resulting x-ray spectral features were
  identified and measured by the on board x-ray spectrometer.  Some of the
  expected elements include iron, silicon, manganese, calcium, aluminum and
  sodium.  By noting the relative abundances of these elements in the
  asteroid's surface minerals and comparing these abundances to those
  measured in various types of meteorites on Earth, a link can be forged
  between the composition of this type of rocky asteroid and the meteorites
  on Earth that likely represent the collision fragments of such asteroids.
  Thereafter, the composition can be inferred for newly discovered
  asteroids that are spectrally similar to the large group of S-type
  asteroids like Itokawa.  Results from the NIRS and X-Ray Spectrometer
  instruments are reported in [ABEETAL2006], [KITAZATOETAL2008],
  [OKADAETAL2006].
 
  LIDAR:  The LIDAR instrument measures the round-trip time of flight of
  infrared laser pulses transmitted from the Hayabusa spacecraft to the
  surface of Itokawa. The instrument operates in a single autonomous mode,
  in which it produces ranging measurements.  Surface topography estimates
  can be derived from these data, given appropriate corrections for the
  position and attitude of the spacecraft.  The principal components of
  LIDAR are a diode-pumped, Nd:YAG laser transmitter that emits 1.064
  micrometer wavelength laser pulses, a 0.126 m diameter telescope, a
  silicon avalanche photodiode detector, and a time interval unit with 14
  nsec resolution. During the long Home Position phase (~7km from Itokawa)
  of the misson, LIDAR provides measurements of the topography of Itokawa
  within approximately 12x4.9 m footprints.  Results from the LIDAR
  instrument are reported in [MUKAIETAL2007].
 
  Sample Collection and Return to Earth: The definitive work on this
  asteroid's composition will be done in Earth-based laboratories after the
  Hayabusa spacecraft returned its precious samples in June 2010.  After
  several weeks during which an initial mapping and reconnaissance phase
  was undertaken, the Hayabusa spacecraft was designed to descend to the
  surface of the asteroid, fire a 5 gram pellet of Tantalum into the
  asteroid's surface and immediately collect and store the resulting
  ejecta.  Tantalum, a rare non-corrosive metal, is used because it is
  very resistance to change and any tantalum found in the collected sample
  will be easily identified. This sampling maneuver could be done up to
  three times.  Because the light travel time between the asteroid and
  Earth was about 18 minutes at the time of the sampling, the spacecraft
  must act without human intervention.  As described below, there was no
  evidence that these pellets were successfully fired but the spacecraft
  did land upon the asteroid's surface so that some surface material was
  disturbed to an extent that allowed some of it to enter the
  sample collection chamber.  The landing attempts are outlined in
  [YANOETAL2006].
 
  On April 25, 2007, the Hayabusa spacecraft departed from the asteroid
  and in June of 2010, the spacecraft approached Earth and ejected the
  small (40 centimeters diameter) aluminum sample return capsule.  The
  sample container entered the Earth's atmosphere at about 12 kilometers
  per second, using ablative shielding to withstand the intense heat
  generated by atmospheric friction, and eventually parachuted down to the
  ground near Woomera Australia.  Eager scientists then collected the
  capsule and took it back to Japan so the asteroid surface samples could be
  carefully removed and distributed to the scientific community for study.
  These sample studies will be carried out using a variety of composition
  measuring devices in Earth based laboratories - devices that are not
  limited to the modest mass, volume, power, and data rates that can be
  accommodated by the Hayabusa spacecraft.  Furthermore, as more advanced
  future instrumentation is developed and new hypotheses arise, archived
  samples from the asteroid will be available for new measurements.
  Preliminary ground-based sample analyses were reported by
  [NAKAMURAETAL2011], [EBIHARAETAL2011], [YURIMOTOETAL2011],
  [NOGUCHIETAL2011],[TSUCHIYAMAETAL2011], and [NAGAOETAL2011]

  Leader (TL), are summarized below:

  Target Asteroid
  ===============
 
  Asteroid 25143 Itokawa:  The orbit of the Hayabusa target body, 25143
  Itokawa, has a low inclination with respect to the Earth's orbital plane
  (1.7 deg.) so it is one of the more accessible asteroids for a
  spacecraft rendezvous.  Fortunately, this asteroid made a close Earth
  approach to within six million kilometers in late March 2001 and an even
  closer Earth approach to within 2 million kilometers in late June 2004.
  Optical, infrared, and radar observations were undertaken in 2001 and
  2004.  The ground-based radar observations indicated that the object has
  a potato shape of approximate dimensions 548 x 312 x 276 meters
  [OSTROETAL2004] while ground-based optical and infrared data suggest
  that Itokawa is an S-type asteroid with a composition analogous to
  either an LL ordinary chondrite, or a primitive achondrite meteorite
  [BINZELETAL2001], [SEKIGUICHIETAL2001], [ABELLETAL2007].  In either case
  the asteroid appeared to be largely a silicate rock with a relatively
  low abundance of iron.  Detailed spectral observations obtained by the
  Hayabusa spacecraft were not able to definitively rule out either
  compositional interpretation [ABEETAL2006]. The spacecraft imaging
  confirmed the general dimensions of the asteroid.  Tables 2 and 3
  provide the orbital and physical characteristics for near-Earth asteroid
  25143 Itokawa as reported in [FUJIWARAETAL2006], [DEMURAETAL2006].

  ================
 
The Dawn spacecraft was successfully launched atop a Delta II rocket
on September 27, 2007.  Dawn is an ion-propelled spacecraft capable
of visiting multiple targets in the main asteroid belt.  In the baseline
mission, Dawn flies to and orbits the main belt asteroids 1 Ceres and
4 Vesta, orbiting Vesta for a period of not less than seven months
and Ceres for not less than five months.  The spacecraft flies by
Mars in a gravity assist maneuver in 2009 en route to Vesta.
 
Dawn carries three science instruments whose data is used to
characterize the target bodies.  The instrument suite consists of
redundant Framing Cameras (FC1 and FC2), a Visible and Infrared mapping
spectrometer (VIR) and a Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND).  In
addition to these instruments, radiometric and optical navigation data
is used to determine the gravity field.  The Dawn mission is an
international cooperation with instrument teams located in Germany, Italy,
and the United States.
 
 
  Science Goals
  =============
 
In order to achieve the overall scientific goal of understanding
conditions and processes acting at the solar system's earliest epoch,
the Dawn spacecraft images the surfaces of the minor planets Vesta
and Ceres to determine their bombardment, thermal, tectonic, and possible
volcanic history. It determines the topography and internal structure
of these two complementary protoplanets that have remained intact since
their formation, by measuring their mass, shape, volume, and spin rate
with navigation data and imagery. Dawn determines mineral and elemental
composition from infrared, gamma ray, and neutron spectroscopy to
constrain the thermal history and compositional evolution of Ceres and
Vesta, and in addition provides context for meteorites (asteroid samples
already in hand). It also uses the spectral information to search for
water-bearing minerals.
 
 
  Instruments
  ===========
 
Framing Camera (FC):
 
The Framing Camera is a multispectral imager that also serves as
an optical navigation camera.  The detector is a 1024x1024 pixel
Atmel/Thomson TH7888A CCD with 14 micron pixels.  It has eight filters
numbered F1 through F8, including a broadband (clear) filter and
narrow band filters ranging from 438 nm to 965 nm.  The Framing camera
instrument includes two redundant cameras of identical design, referred
to as FC1 and FC2.  For full information about the FC instrument, see
Schroeder and Gutierrez-Marques (2008).
 
Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIR):
 
VIR is an imaging spectrometer with an optical design derived from
the visible channel of the Cassini Visible Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer (VIMS-V) and from the Rosetta Visible Infrared Thermal
Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS).  It has moderate resolution and
combines two data channels in one instrument.  The two data channels,
Visible (spectral range 0.25-1 micron) and Infrared (spectral range
0.95-5 micron), are committed to spectral mapping and are housed
in the same optical subsystem.  The spectrometer has the ability to
point and scan along the direction perpendicular to the slit.  A
complete description of the instrument and its performance can be
found in Bini et al. (2005).
 
Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND):
 
GRaND is a nuclear spectrometer that will collect data needed to map
the elemental composition of the surfaces of 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres
(Prettyman et al. 2003B).  GRaND measures the spectrum of planetary
gamma rays and neutrons, which originate from cosmic ray interactions
and radioactive decay within the surface, while the spacecraft is in
orbit around each body.  The instrument, which is mounted on the
+Z deck of the spacecraft, consists of 21 sensors designed to
separately measure radiation originating from the surface of each
asteroid and background sources, including the space energetic
particle environment and cosmic ray interactions with the spacecraft.
A complete description of GRaND is given in the GRaND instrument
paper, Prettyman et al. (2011). Instrument performance during cruise
and Mars Flyby is given by Prettyman et al. (2012).

The following mission phase activities are summarized from the Dawn
Dawn Science Plan (Raymond 2007).
 
Initial Checkout (ICO) - ICO covers the 60-day period following launch
and is used to turn on and perform initial checkout of the instruments.
Only a minimal set of instrument checkout activities are performed
during ICO to minimize interference with critical spacecraft checkouts.
 
Cruise Phases - Seven days of non-thrusting periods per year are
designated for science calibration activities.  These periods are
used to perform functional, performance, and calibration tests of the
instruments using stellar and planetary targets.  During cruise,
GRaND measures the response to galactic cosmic rays and energetic
particles in the space environment, characterizing the background
sources.
 
Mars Gravity Assist (MGA) - The purpose of MGA is to add energy to the
spacecraft trajectory to ensure adequate mass and power margins for
the designated trajectory.   In addition, the MGA provides an
opportunity for instrument calibration, a readiness exercise for
Vesta operations, an absolute calibration of GRaND, and an
extended source for calibrating VIR and FC.  VIR obtains
scientifically valuable spectroscopy.  GRaND acquires data for direct
comparison with data from 2001 Mars Odyssey, enabling cross calibration
during flight.  None of the data gathered at Mars are critical to
achieving the goals of the mission.
 
Approach Phases - During the Vesta Approach phase the instruments
go through complete calibration, repeating some of the activities
that were done during the post-launch checkout calibration period,
including annealing GRaND if necessary.  For both Vesta and Ceres
Approach phases, the FC collects rotation characterization (RC) maps
and VIR obtains full-disc spectra coincident with the RCs.  Data
obtained in the Approach phases provide a range of illumination angles
to initialize the topographic model, and data to aid in finalizing
the plans for HAMO and LAMO.  During the approach phases several
searches for hazards (dust, moons) are performed in the near-asteroid
environment.  An additional activity in the Vesta Approach phase is
to exercise the processing streams for the instruments' data, mainly
the FC and VIR, to verify that quicklook products can be produced on
the required timelines, and to check and improve the calibration
parameters.
 
Survey Orbits - The goals for the Vesta and Ceres survey orbits are
to obtain global coverage with VIR, and to create overlapping global
images with the FC in multiple filters.  The VIR map consititutes the
primary (and perhaps only) global reference set.  The VIR and FC global
maps will be used for defining targets to be investigated at lower
altitudes, and the FC data will contribute significantly to the
topographic model.  Cross-calibration of the VIR and FC will be
facilitated by concurrent imaging during this phase.
 
High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) - The HAMO is used primarily to
create global FC maps of the lighted surface of the body in multiple
filters from a nadir attitude, and two clear-filter maps from two
different off-nadir viewing angles.  These maps will be used to
create a topographic model.  VIR will also collect at least 5000
frames to sample the spectral variability at smaller scales than the
global survey map, and to build up high-resolution coverage of
areas of interest.  Additional imaging is planned near the end of
the encounter (after LAMO), as the spacecraft is spiraling out from
the asteroid, to capture different lighting conditions and fill in
gaps in the coverage.  These activities will not constitute a
separate mission phase, but will supplement the HAMO objectives in
order to complete the global FC mosaics in multiple filters, and
obtain supplemental VIR coverage of selected targets.
 
Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) - The purpose of LAMO is to obtain
spatially resolved neutron and gamma ray spectra of the asteroid, and
global tracking coverage to determine the gravity field.  In addition,
as much FC and VIR nadir imaging as can be fit into the data buffers
will be obtained.  Data lost or not acquired in HAMO that are needed
to complete the global mapping may be acquired in LAMO using very
short FC exposures or using target motion compensation.  Off-nadir
targeted acquisition is anticipated for a small fraction of the time,
including some very high resolution imaging of selected targets.  A
dedicated gravity campaign (several days to one week) will be used for
resolving the wobble in rotation to measure the moment of inertia of
the asteroid.

      Deep Space 1 with permission of the web site NASA Responsible

  Mission Overview
  ================
    The primary goal of the DS1 mission was to validate advanced, high
    risk technologies that are important for future space and Earth
    science programs.  Secondary goals were scientific in nature, and
    included obtaining images, spectra  and particles and fields
    measurements of a near-Earth asteroid and a comet.
 
    Deep Space 1 was launched from Pad 17-A at the Cape Canaveral Air
    Station at 12:08 UT (8:08 a.m. EDT), 24 October 1998, the first
    launch under NASA's Med-Lite booster program, on a Delta 7326-9.5
    (a Delta II Lite launch vehicle with three strap-on solid-rocket
    boosters and a Star 37FM third stage). At 13:01 UT the third stage
    burn put DS1 into its solar orbit trajectory. DS1 separated from
    the Delta II about 550 km above the Indian Ocean. Telemetry was
    received by the NASA Deep Space Network 1 hour, 37 minutes after
    launch, a 13 minute delay from the expected time. The reason for
    the delay is not known.
 
    DS1 flew by the near-Earth asteroid 9969 Braille (1999 K2) at
    04:46 UT (12:46 a.m. EDT) on 29 July 1999 at a distance of about
    26 km at approximately 15.5 km/sec relative velocity. A software
    problem caused the spacecraft to go into a safing mode at
    approximately 12:00 UT on 28 July, but the problem was solved and
    the spacecraft returned to normal operations at 18:00 UT. Up to
    six minor trajectory correction maneuvers were scheduled in the 48
    hours prior to the flyby. The spacecraft made its final pre-
    encounter transmission about 7 hours before closest approach,
    after which it turned its high-gain antenna away from Earth to
    point the MICAS camera/spectrometer camera towards the asteroid.
    The spacecraft had a target-tracking problem and the MICAS
    instrument was not pointed towards the asteroid as it approached,
    so no images or spectra were obtained. MICAS turned off about 25
    seconds before closest approach at a distance of about 350 km and
    measurements were taken with the PEPE plasma instrument. The
    spacecraft then turned after the encounter to obtain images and
    spectra of the opposite side of the asteroid as it receded from
    view, but due to the target-tracking problem only two black and
    white images and a dozen spectra were obtained. The images were
    taken at 915 and 932 seconds after closest approach from 14,000 km
    and the spectra were taken about 3 minutes later. The data were
    transmitted back to Earth over the next few days. The diameter of
    Braille is estimated at 2.2 km at its longest and 1 km at its
    shortest. The spectra showed it to be similar to the asteroid
    Vesta.
 
    The primary mission lasted until 18 September 1999, after which
    the spacecraft entered an extended mission phase.  Early in this
    phase, the commercial star tracker failed, leaving the craft
    unable to point its main antenna toward Earth or operate its ion
    propulsion system.  A two-phase approach allowed recovery of the
    mission. First, ground crews devised a new method of pointing the
    high-gain antenna at the Earth, so the radio signal received at
    the Deep Space Network could be used as an indicator of the
    spacecraft attitude. Second, new software was developed to allow
    the science camera to perform the duties of the star tracker,
    allowing the spacecraft to return to three-axis operation and
    continue its mission.
 
    DS1 flew by Comet 19P/Borrelly at 22:30 UT on 22 September 2001 (8
    days after the comet's perihelion).  The flyby occurred at a
    distance of 2171 km with approximately 16.58 km/sec relative
    velocity.  At the time, 19P/Borrelly was 1.36 AU from the sun and
    1.48 AU from the Earth.  Three different types of science data
    were obtained during the encounter: The miniature integrated
    camera and spectrometer (MICAS) obtained both optical (0.5 to 1.0
    microns) images, and spectra from 1.3 to 2.6 microns, and the
    Plasma Experiment for Planetary Exploration (PEPE) obtained
    measurements of the ion and electron energy and ion mass to charge
    ratios.  The images obtained near closest approach represent the
    highest resolution images of a comet's nucleus to date.
 
 
  Mission Phases

    DS1 Mission Timeline
 
     Launch (Cape Canaveral, Florida):      24 Oct 1998
     Instrument verification completed:     13 Jul 1999
     Asteroid Braille (1992 K2) encounter:  28 Jul 1999
     End of primary mission:                18 Sep 1999
     Coast period (MICAS observes Mars):    20 Oct 1999
     Star tracker failure:                  11 Nov 1999
     Comet Borrelly encounter:              22 Sep 2001
     Deep Space 1 retired:                  18 Dec 2001
 
    Launch:
 
    Following launch, several days were spent conducting an evaluation
    of the spacecraft, verifying its health and preparing it for
    mission operations.   Dedicated technology experiments began
    within a week of launch.  Of course, some technologies were used
    as part of regular spacecraft operations, in particular the solar
    array, transponder, and AuotNav, but those and all other
    technologies also were subjected to in depth characterization
    tests.   Radiometric determination of the trajectory was combined
    with results of the IPS tests to generate and optimize an updated
    low-thrust trajectory that was transmitted to the spacecraft.
    After verification of its functional capability, AutoNav was tuned
    in flight, particularly to account for discrepancies between the
    predicted and the actual MICAS images.   As the mission
    progressed, more reliance was placed on AutoNav, with conventional
    navigation used to validate its performance.  After ten days of
    thrusting, the spacecraft was turned to thrust along the vector
    (subject to a variety of constraints) for reaching the encounter
    targets for the primary and extended mission.
 
    Cruise 1:
 
    In February 1999, a completely new software load of 4.1 MB was
    installed. This new software enabled the testing of four of the
    previously excluded technologies (the software package remote
    agent was not in this load), upgraded AutoNav (to accommodate
    scattered light in the MICAS images), fixed bugs identified after
    launch and improved spacecraft operability.  To accommodate the
    remote agent experiments in May, the flight software was patched
    and remote agent software was uploaded. In June, following the
    remote agent experiment, the flight software was replaced again.
    This last load contained new operational enhancements and upgrades
    to a number of systems, including AutoNav upgrades for enhanced
    image processing and functions needed to execute encounters.
 
    The thrusting for the primary mission was accomplished in two
    major periods. The brief hiatus in the thrust arc was inserted to
    allow days for activation and initial testing of PEPE in the
    absence of the IPS plasma, and experiments incompatible with the
    IPS thrust attitude. The second thrust segment ended on April 27,
    1999.
 
    Braille Encounter:
 
    All the technology testing was completed by July 1999.  Following
    the end of the testing, on July 29, 1999, the DS1 spacecraft
    encountered (9969) 1992 KD at 15.5 km/s. As a result, the closest
    approach to Braille was 28.3 +/- km rather than the planned 15 km.
    The asteroid is believed to be elongated with a mean radius of
    roughly 2 km and is the smallest solar system body targeted by
    DS1. During the final days of the spacecraft's approach to the
    body, AutoNav did lock onto the asteroid but the accuracy was not
    high.
 
    Cruise 2:
 
    Following the encounter with Braille, DS1 had months of thrusting
    until the primary mission ended on Sept 18, 1999.  When DS1 was
    launched, the plan for the primary mission incorporated a plan for
    an extended mission taking the spacecraft to comet Borrelly.  The
    extension was approved by NASA in August 1999.  Most of the
    extended mission would be devoted to IPS thrusting.  On Oct 20
    1999, a coast period began which lasted through mid-December 1999
    during which calibrations of all MICAS channels were conducted.
    On November 11, 1999, after all the Mars infrared spectra were
    taken, the spacecraft's stellar reference unit (SRU) stopped
    reporting attitude data to the spacecraft computer.   On June 21,
    2000, the IPS thrusting was restarted under routine operations.
 
    Borrelly Encounter:
 
    Following its primary mission, DS1 embarked on an extended mission
    devoted to comet science.   In November 1999, the spacecraft had
    suffered the loss if its stellar reference unit (SRU), its source
    of 3-axis attitude knowledge.   This was considered to be
    catastrophic, but the operations team completed an ambitious two-
    phase, 7-month recovery that included the development of new
    software and new methods for operating the spacecraft.
 
    One feature of the recovery was to use the visible CCD camera in
    the miniature integrated camera/spectrometer (MICAS), one of the
    technologies tested during the primary mission, as an attitude
    sensor. The problem of navigating to the vicinity of the comet was
    different from that of reaching a typical planetary encounter,
    because the uncertainty in the comet's ephemeris dominated
    navigation errors. From 25 August to 10 hours before the closest
    approach to September 22, DS1 conducted 11 imaging sessions
    spanning ranges to the comet of 40.3 x 10^6 km to 6 x 10^5 km.
 
    On approach to Borrelly, DS1 viewed the comet near the south
    ecliptic pole.   The spacecraft's  approach of 2171 km was at
    22:29:33 UTC on 22 September 2001, with v(inf) = 16.58 km/s.  The
    encounter took place 1.36 AU from the Sun, 8 days after
    perihelion.
 
    Science data were acquired with 3 instrument suites. All were
    body- fixed, so pointing required spacecraft maneuvers. MICAS'
    1024 x 1024 CCD with 13-micro-rad pixels collected images in the
    range of 0.5 to 1.0 micrometer. MICAS also obtained spectra from
    1.3 to 2.6 micrometers with a sampling interval of 7 nm. Ion and
    electron energy and angle spectra and ion mass/charge measurements
    were made with an instrument included on the flight, the plasma
    experiment for planetary exploration (PEPE). Over its 2.8pi sr
    field of view, PEPE was sensitive between 8 eV and 32 keV, with a
    resolution of 5% (energy and mass/charge). Magnetic field and
    plasma wave measurements were made with sensors that had been
    carried as an assessment of the IPS. These IPS diagnostic sensors
    (IDS) measured the effects of the IPS on the spacecraft and space
    environment during the primary mission and were reprogrammed in
    flight to collect cometary science data.
 
    Cruise 3 (HYPEREXTENDED MISSION):
 
    The return of the data from Borrelly concluded DS1's two-year
    extended mission.   The spacecraft was undamaged by the encounter
    and continued operating after the extended mission.
 
    DS1's hyperextended mission included testing eight of the
    technologies onboard, with a focus on the IPS. On 18 December
    2001, following the last IPS test and the dumping of some final
    data, a command was sent to place the spacecraft in one of its
    safe states, now with the downlink off. This last command product
    was the 9905th of the mission.]]></field>

    22:29:33 UTC on 22 September 2001, with v(inf) = 16.58 km/s.  The
    encounter took place 1.36 AU from the Sun, 8 days after
    perihelion.
 
    Science data were acquired with 3 instrument suites. All were
    body- fixed, so pointing required spacecraft maneuvers. MICAS'
    1024 x 1024 CCD with 13-micro-rad pixels collected images in the
    range of 0.5 to 1.0 micrometer. MICAS also obtained spectra from
    1.3 to 2.6 micrometers with a sampling interval of 7 nm. Ion and
    electron energy and angle spectra and ion mass/charge measurements
    were made with an instrument included on the flight, the plasma
    experiment for planetary exploration (PEPE). Over its 2.8pi sr
    field of view, PEPE was sensitive between 8 eV and 32 keV, with a
    resolution of 5% (energy and mass/charge). Magnetic field and
    plasma wave measurements were made with sensors that had been
    carried as an assessment of the IPS. These IPS diagnostic sensors
    (IDS) measured the effects of the IPS on the spacecraft and space
    environment during the primary mission and were reprogrammed in
    flight to collect cometary science data.
 
    Cruise 3 (HYPEREXTENDED MISSION):
 
    The return of the data from Borrelly concluded DS1's two-year
    extended mission.   The spacecraft was undamaged by the encounter
    and continued operating after the extended mission.
 
    DS1's hyperextended mission included testing eight of the
    technologies onboard, with a focus on the IPS. On 18 December
    2001, following the last IPS test and the dumping of some final
    data, a command was sent to place the spacecraft in one of its
    safe states, now with the downlink off. This last command product
    was the 9905th of the mission.]]></field>

<field name="investigation_objectives_summary"><![CDATA[Deep Space 1 (DS1) is the first project of the New Millennium
    program. Its payload consists of 12 technologies. The criteria for
    'complete mission success' are:
 
    1) Demonstrate the in-space flight operations and quantify the
       performance of the following five advanced technologies:
 
    - Solar electric propulsion (SEP)
    - Solar concentrator arrays
    - Autonomous navigation
    - Miniature camera and imaging spectrometer
    - Small deep space transponder and any three of the following six
      advanced technologies:
 
       - Ka-band solid state power amplifier
       - Beacon monitor operations
       - Autonomous remote agent
       - Low power electronics
       - Power actuation and switching module
       - Multifunctional structure
 
    2) Acquire the data necessary to quantify the performance of these
       advanced technologies by September 30, 1999. Analyze these data
       and disseminate the results to interested organizations/parties
       by March 1, 2000.
 
    3) Utilize the on-board ion propulsion system (IPS) to propel the
       DS1 spacecraft on a trajectory that will encounter an asteroid
       in fiscal year 1999.
 
    4) Assess the interaction of the IPS operations with the
       spacecraft and its potential impact on charged particle, radio
       waves and plasma, and other science investigations on future
       SEP-propelled deep space missions.
 
    A twelfth technology, a miniature integrated ion and electron
    spectrometer, was not included in the success criteria, because it
    was so late in being delivered that even six weeks before launch
    it was uncertain whether the device would be ready. It was
    delivered and performed very well.]]></field>

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
    Mars Express was the first flexible mission of the revised long-term
    ESA Science Programme Horizons 2000 and was launched to the planet
    Mars from Baikonur (Kazakhstan) on June 2nd 2003.  A Soyuz-Fregat
    launcher injected the Mars Express total mass of about 1200 kg into
    Mars transfer orbit. Details about the mission launch sequence and
    profile can be obtained from the Mission Plan [MEX-MMT-RP-0221] and
    from the Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis (CREMA)
    [MEX-ESC-RP-5500].
 
    The mission consisted of (i) a 3-axis stabilized orbiter with a fixed
    high-gain antenna and body-mounted instruments, and (ii) a lander
    named BEAGLE-2, and was dedicated to the orbital and in-situ study of
    the interior, subsurface, surface and atmosphere of the planet. After
    ejection of a small lander on 18 December 2003 and Mars orbit
    insertion (MOI) on 25 December 2003, the orbiter experiments began
    the acquisition of scientific data from Mars and its environment in a
    polar elliptical orbit.
 
    The nominal mission lifetime for the orbiter was 687 days following
    Mars orbit insertion, starting after a 5 months cruise. The nominal
    science phase was extended (tbc) for another Martian year in order to
    complement earlier observations and allow data relay communications
    for various potential Mars landers up to 2008, provided that the
    spacecraft resources permit it.
 
    The Mars Express spacecraft represented the core of the mission,
    being scientifically justified on its own by investigations such
    as high- resolution imaging and mineralogical mapping of the
    surface, radar sounding of the subsurface structure down to the
    permafrost, precise determination of the atmospheric circulation
    and composition, and study of the interaction of the atmosphere
    with the interplanetary medium. The broad scientific objectives of
    the orbiter payload are briefly listed thereafter and are given
    more extensively in the experiment publications contained in ESA's
    Special Publication Series. See [NEUKUM&JAUMANN2004],
    [BIBRINGETAL2004], [PICARDIETAL2004], [FORMISANOETAL2004],
    [BERTAUXETAL2004], [PAETZOLDETAL2004] and [PULLANETAL2004].
 
    The Mars Express lander Beagle-2 was ejected towards the Mars
    surface on 19 December 2003, six days before the orbiters capture
    manoeuvre. The probe mass was limited to about 70 kg by the
    mission constraints, which led to a landed mass of 32 kg. The
    complete experimental package was weighed in approximately at 9kg.
    The landers highly integrated scientific payload was supposed to
    focus on finding whether there is convincing evidence for past
    life on Mars or assessing if the conditions were ever suitable.
    Following safe landing on Mars, this lander mission would have
    conducted dedicated studies of the geology, mineralogy,
    geochemistry, meteorology and exobiology of the immediate landing
    site located in Isidis Planitia (90.74 deg E, 11.6 deg N), as well
    as studies of the chemistry of the Martian atmosphere. Surface
    operations were planned to last about 180 sols or Martian days (
    about 6 months on Earth), see [SIMSETAL1999]. As no communication
    could be established to the BEAGLE-2 lander, it was considered
    lost in February 2004 after an extensive 'search'.
 
    A nominal launch of Mars Express allowed the modify the orbit to a
    'G3-ubeq100' orbit. The 'G3-ubeq100' orbit is an elliptical orbit,
    starting with the sub-spacecraft point at pericentre at the equator
    and a sun elevation of 60 degrees.
    At the beginning of the mission, the pericentre moves southward with
    a shift of 0.54 degree per day. At the same time the pericentre steps
    towards the terminator which will be reached after about 4 months,
    giving the optical instruments optimal observing conditions during
    this initial period. Throughout this initial phase lasting until mid-
    May 2004, the downlink rate will decrease from 114 kbit/s to
    38 kbit/s.
    After an orbit change manoeuvre on 06 May 2004 the pericentre
    latitude motion is increased to guarantee a 50/50 balance between
    dayside and nightside operations. With this manoeuvre, the apocentre
    altitude is lowered from 14887 km to 13448 km, the orbital period
    lowered from ~7.6 hours to 6.645 hours, and the pericentre latitude
    drift slightly increased to 0.64 degree per day.
    After 150 days, at the beginning of June 2004, the South pole region
    was reached with the pericentre already behind the terminator.
    Following, the pericentre moves northward with the Sun elevation
    increasing. Thus, the optical instruments covered the Northern Mars
    hemisphere under good illumination conditions from mid-September 2004
    to March 2005.
    During the next mission phase, lasting until July 2005, the
    pericentre was again in the dark. It covered the North polar region
    and moves southward.
    Finally, throughout the last 4 months of the nominal mission, the
    pericentre was back to daylight and moves from the equator to the
    South pole, and the downlink rate reached its highest rate of 228
    kbit/s. The osculating orbit elements for the eq100 orbit are listed
    below:

       conditions).
       Observational conditions were most favorable for the optical
       imaging instruments at the end of the routine phase, when both
       data downlink rate and Sun elevation are high.
 
    (vii) MARSIS Deployment
       The dates of the MARSIS antenna deployment is not known as of
       writing this catalogue file.
 
    (viii) Extended operations phase
       A mission extension will be proposed in early 2005 to the Science
       Programme Committee (SPC).
 
    (ix) Post-mission phase (final data archival).
 
 
  Science Subphases
  =================
    For the purpose of structuring further the payload operations
    planning, the mission phases are further divided into science
    subphases. The science subphases are defined according to operational
    restrictions, the main operational restrictions being the downlink
    rate and the Sun elevation.
 
    The Mars Commissioning Phase and the Mars Routine Phase are therefore
    divided into a number of science subphases using various combinations
    of Sun elevations and available downlink bit rates.
 
    The discrete downlink rates available throughout the nominal mission
    are:
     -  28 kbits/seconds
     -  38 kbits/seconds
     -  45 kbits/seconds
     -  57 kbits/seconds
     -  76 kbits/seconds
     -  91 kbits/seconds
     - 114 kbits/seconds
     - 152 kbits/seconds
     - 182 kbits/seconds
     - 228 kbits/seconds
 
    The adopted Sun elevation coding convention is as follows:
     - HSE for High Sun Elevation (> 60 degrees)
     - MSE for Medium Sun Elevation (between 20 and 60 degrees)
     - LSE for Low Sun Elevation (between -15 and 20 degrees)
     - NSE for Negative Sun Elevation (< -15 degrees)
 
    The science subphase naming convention is as follows:
      - Science Phase
      - Sun Elevation Code
      - Downlink Rate
      - Science Subphase Repetition Number
 
    The following tables gives the available Science Subphases:

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
    Mars Express was the first flexible mission of the revised long-term
    ESA Science Programme Horizons 2000 and was launched to the planet
    Mars from Baikonur (Kazakhstan) on June 2nd 2003.  A Soyuz-Fregat
    launcher injected the Mars Express total mass of about 1200 kg into
    Mars transfer orbit. Details about the mission launch sequence and
    profile can be obtained from the Mission Plan [MEX-MMT-RP-0221] and
    from the Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis (CREMA)
    [MEX-ESC-RP-5500].
 
    The mission consisted of (i) a 3-axis stabilized orbiter with a fixed
    high-gain antenna and body-mounted instruments, and (ii) a lander
    named BEAGLE-2, and was dedicated to the orbital and in-situ study of
    the interior, subsurface, surface and atmosphere of the planet. After
    ejection of a small lander on 18 December 2003 and Mars orbit
    insertion (MOI) on 25 December 2003, the orbiter experiments began
    the acquisition of scientific data from Mars and its environment in a
    polar elliptical orbit.
 
    The nominal mission lifetime for the orbiter was 687 days following
    Mars orbit insertion, starting after a 5 months cruise. The nominal
    science phase was extended (tbc) for another Martian year in order to
    complement earlier observations and allow data relay communications
    for various potential Mars landers up to 2008, provided that the
    spacecraft resources permit it.
 
    The Mars Express spacecraft represented the core of the mission,
    being scientifically justified on its own by investigations such
    as high- resolution imaging and mineralogical mapping of the
    surface, radar sounding of the subsurface structure down to the
    permafrost, precise determination of the atmospheric circulation
    and composition, and study of the interaction of the atmosphere
    with the interplanetary medium. The broad scientific objectives of
    the orbiter payload are briefly listed thereafter and are given
    more extensively in the experiment publications contained in ESA's
    Special Publication Series. See [NEUKUM&JAUMANN2004],
    [BIBRINGETAL2004], [PICARDIETAL2004], [FORMISANOETAL2004],
    [BERTAUXETAL2004], [PAETZOLDETAL2004] and [PULLANETAL2004].
 
    The Mars Express lander Beagle-2 was ejected towards the Mars
    surface on 19 December 2003, six days before the orbiters capture
    manoeuvre. The probe mass was limited to about 70 kg by the
    mission constraints, which led to a landed mass of 32 kg. The
    complete experimental package was weighed in approximately at 9kg.
    The landers highly integrated scientific payload was supposed to
    focus on finding whether there is convincing evidence for past
    life on Mars or assessing if the conditions were ever suitable.
    Following safe landing on Mars, this lander mission would have
    conducted dedicated studies of the geology, mineralogy,
    geochemistry, meteorology and exobiology of the immediate landing
    site located in Isidis Planitia (90.74 deg E, 11.6 deg N), as well
    as studies of the chemistry of the Martian atmosphere. Surface
    operations were planned to last about 180 sols or Martian days (
    about 6 months on Earth), see [SIMSETAL1999]. As no communication
    could be established to the BEAGLE-2 lander, it was considered
    lost in February 2004 after an extensive 'search'.
 
    A nominal launch of Mars Express allowed the modify the orbit to a
    'G3-ubeq100' orbit. The 'G3-ubeq100' orbit is an elliptical orbit,
    starting with the sub-spacecraft point at pericentre at the equator
    and a sun elevation of 60 degrees.
    At the beginning of the mission, the pericentre moves southward with
    a shift of 0.54 degree per day. At the same time the pericentre steps
    towards the terminator which will be reached after about 4 months,
    giving the optical instruments optimal observing conditions during
    this initial period. Throughout this initial phase lasting until mid-
    May 2004, the downlink rate will decrease from 114 kbit/s to
    38 kbit/s.
    After an orbit change manoeuvre on 06 May 2004 the pericentre
    latitude motion is increased to guarantee a 50/50 balance between
    dayside and nightside operations. With this manoeuvre, the apocentre
    altitude is lowered from 14887 km to 13448 km, the orbital period
    lowered from ~7.6 hours to 6.645 hours, and the pericentre latitude
    drift slightly increased to 0.64 degree per day.
    After 150 days, at the beginning of June 2004, the South pole region
    was reached with the pericentre already behind the terminator.
    Following, the pericentre moves northward with the Sun elevation
    increasing. Thus, the optical instruments covered the Northern Mars
    hemisphere under good illumination conditions from mid-September 2004
    to March 2005.
    During the next mission phase, lasting until July 2005, the
    pericentre was again in the dark. It covered the North polar region
    and moves southward.
    Finally, throughout the last 4 months of the nominal mission, the
    pericentre was back to daylight and moves from the equator to the
    South pole, and the downlink rate reached its highest rate of 228
    kbit/s. The osculating orbit elements for the eq100 orbit are listed
    below:
 
    Epoch                                 2004:1:13 - 15:56:0.096
    Pericentre (rel. sphere of 3397.2 km) 279.29 km

      payload of Mars Express.
    - Its primary mission was to provide the data services for the
      Beagle-2 lander.
    - It was designed to relay at least 10 Mbits of information per day.
 
    IR Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer   OMEGA
    - Global mineralogical mapping at 100-m resolution.
    - Identification and characterisation of specific mineral and
      molecular phases of the surface.
    - Identification and characterisation of photometric units.
    - Mapping of their spatial distribution and abundance.

    Planetary Fourier Spectrometer   PFS
    - Characterisation of the global atmospheric circulation.
    - Mapping of the atmospheric composition.
    - Study of the mineralogical composition and of surface atmosphere
      interactions.
 
    UV and IR Atmospheric Spectrometer   SPICAM
    - Study of the global structure and composition of the Martian
      atmosphere.
    - Study of surface-atmosphere interactions.
 
    Visual Monitoring Camera   VMC
    - Stand-alone digital camera to take colour snapshots of the Beagle
      lander.
    - Operation of this camera will occur during separation of the lander
 
    Geochemistry and Exobiology Lander  BEAGLE-2
 
    The top-level scientific objectives of the lander are:
      - Geological investigation of the local terrain and rocks (light
        element chemistry, composition, mineralogy, petrology, age).
      - Investigation of the oxidation state of the Martian surface.
      - Full characterisation of the atmospheric composition.
      - Search for criteria that demonstrated life processes appeared in
        the past.
      - Determination of trace atmospheric gases.
 
    When folded up Beagle 2 resembles a pocket watch. However, as soon as
    it comes to a halt on the Martian surface its outer casting will open
    to reveal the inner workings. Firstly the solar panels will unfold -
    catching sunlight the charge the batteries which will power the
    lander and its experiments throughout the mission. Next, a robotic
    arm will spring to life. Attached to the end of the arm is the PAW
    (Position Adjustable Workload) where most of the experiments are
    located. These include a pair of stereo cameras, a microscope, two
    types of spectrometer, and a torch to illuminate surfaces. The PAW
    also houses the corer/grinder and the mole, two devices for
    collecting rock and soil samples for analysis.
 
    Scientific Objectives
 
     Gas Analysis Package
      This is where investigations most relevant to detecting past or
      present life will be conducted. The instrument has twelve ovens in
      which rock and soil samples can be heated gradually in the presence
      of oxygen. The carbon dioxide generated at each temperature will be
      delivered to a mass spctrometer, which will measure its abundance
      and the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13. The mass spectrometer will
      also study other elements and look for methane in samples of
      atmosphere. The temperature at which the carbon dioxide is
      generated will reveal its nature, as different carbon bearing
      materials combust at different temperatures.
 
     Environmental sensors
       A variety of tiny sensors scattered about the Beagle 2 lander will
       measure different aspects of the Martian environment including
       atmospheric pressure ,air temperature and wind speed and
       direction; ultra-violet (UV radiation; dust fall out and the
       density and pressure of the upper atmosphere during Beagle 2's
       descent through the atmosphere.
 
     Two stereo cameras
       The cameras will provide digital pictures from which a 3D model of
       the area within the reach of the robotic arm may be constructed.
       As the PAW cannot be operated in real time from Earth, this 3D
       model will be used to guide the instruments into position
       alongside target rocks and soil and to provide information on the
       geological setting of the landing site.
 
     Microscope
      The microscope will pick out features a few thousandths of a
      millimetre across on rock surfaces exposed by the grinder. It will
      reveal the texture of the rock, which will help determine whether
      it is of sedimentary or volcanic origin.
 
     Mossbauer Spectrometer
      It will investigate the mineral composition of rocks by irradiating
      exposed rock surfaces and soil with gamma rays emitted by an
      isotopic source, cobalt-57, and then measuring the spectrum of the
      gamma-rays reflected back. In particular, the nature of the iron
      minerals in the pristine interior and weathered surface of the
      rocks will be compared to determine the oxidising nature of the
      present atmosphere.
 
     X-ray spectrometer
      This will measure the elemental composition of rocks by bombarding
      exposed rock surfaces with X-rays from four radioactive sources
      (two iron-55 and two cadmium-109). The rocks will emit lower energy
      X-rays characteristic of the elements present. Rock ages will be
      estimated using the property that the isotope potassium-40 decays
      to argon-40. The X-ray spectrometer will provide the potassium
      measure and the GAP will measure argon trapped in rocks.
 
     Mole
      The mole will be able to crawl up to several metres across the
      surface at a rate of 1cm every six seconds. Once it has reached a
      boulder, it will burrow underground to collect samples in a cavity
      in its tip. Alternatively, the PAW can be positioned such that the
      mole will burrow underground to collect samples possibly 1.5m below
      the surface.
 
     Corer/Grinder
       The corer/grinder consists of a drill bit which can either be
       moved over a surface to remove weathered material, or be
       positioned in one spot to drill a core of hopefully pristine
       samples.]]></field>

  ================
    Apollo 14 was launched on 31 January 1971 UT 21:03:02 on a Saturn V
    rocket from Kennedy Space Center.  Lunar orbit insertion took place on
    4 February 1971 UT 06:59:43. The Lunar Module (LM) landed on the Moon
    on 5 February 1971 UT 09:18:11, in the hilly upland region 24 km north
    of the rim of Fra Mauro crater at 3.6 S, 17.5 W, while the
    Command/Service Module (CSM) orbited the Moon. The lunar ascent module
    launched from the Moon on 6 February 1971 UT 18:48:42.  The command
    module returned to Earth on 9 February 1971 UT 21:05:00.
 
    The astronauts on Apollo 14 were commander Alan Shepard, Jr., command
    module pilot Stuart Roosa, and lunar module pilot Edgar Mitchell.
 
    The astronauts made two moonwalk EVA's totaling 9 hours, 23 minutes,
    one on 5 February and one on 6 February, during which the Apollo Lunar
    Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) was placed on the surface and
    activated, 42.9 kg of lunar samples were acquired, and photographs
    were taken.  The lunar surface stay-time was 33.5 hours. The duration
    of the lunar orbit was 66.6 hours for a total of 34 orbits.
 
 
  Surface Operations
  ==================
    Shepard and Mitchell made two moonwalk extra-vehicular activities
    (EVAs) totaling 9 hours, 23 minutes.  During this time the astronauts
    traversed a total of 3.45 km and collected 42.9 kg of lunar samples.
    The first EVA began at 14:42:13 UT on 5 February and ended at 19:30:03
    UT.  During this first EVA the astronauts deployed the ALSEP and other
    experiments in the vicinity of the Lunar Module near Doublet Crater.
    During the second EVA, which took place from 8:11:15 to 12:45:56 UT
    on 6 February, the astronauts walked almost to the rim of nearby
    Cone crater, stopping at 13 stations, collecting samples and taking
    panoramic photographs and magnetometer measurements along the traverse.
    The astronauts did not reach the rim of Cone Crater as planned but
    came within about 20 meters of the edge.  The traverse totaled
    approximately 3 km distance, heading out past Triplet, Weird, and
    Flank Craters and returning along a nearly parallel route.  At the
    end of this walk Shepard used a contingency sampler with a 6-iron
    connected to the end to hit two golf balls.  The LM lifted off the
    Moon on 6 February at 18:48:42 UT after 33 hours, 31 minutes on the
    lunar surface.
 
 
  Surface Experiments
  ===================
    The Apollo 14 astronauts performed and deployed many experiments on
    the lunar surface along with the geologic studies, sample return, and
    surface photography.
 
      - The Soil Mechanics Investigations studied the physical properties
        of the lunar regolith through photography and astronaut
        observations.
 
      - The Solar Wind Composition experiment collected samples of solar
        wind on a large piece of foil which was returned to Earth.
 
      - The Lunar Portable Magnetometer, deployed by the astronauts at
        various locations near the landing site to study local magnetic
        sources.
 
    Other experiments were part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments
    Package (ALSEP) which was emplaced at the landing site by the
    astronauts.  The instruments, connected by cables to a central station
    which controlled power and communications, ran autonomously.  Data
    collected was converted to a telemetry format and transmitted to
    Earth.  Many of these experiments returned data until January 1976,
    when the ALSEP network was turned off due to budgetary constraints.
 
    The Apollo 14 ALSEP instruments consisted of:
 
      - A Passive Seismometer, designed to measure seismic activity and
        physical properties of the lunar crust and interior.
 
      - An Active Seismometer, designed to study the physical properties
        of the lunar surface and subsurface materials and the structure of
        the local near-surface layers.
 
      - A Suprathermal Ion Detector. Designed to measure positive ions
        reaching the lunar surface to provide data on the plasma
        interaction between the solar wind and the Moon.
 
      - A Cold Cathode Ion Gage, designed to measure the density of
        neutral particles in the tenuous lunar atmosphere.
 
      - A Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment, designed to
        measure the energy spectra of low-energy charged particles
        striking the lunar surface.
 
      - A Lunar Dust Detector, designed to assess the long-term effects of
        the lunar dust, radiation, and thermal environment on solar cells.
 
      - A Laser Ranging Retroreflector, designed to reflect laser pulses
        from Earth back to their point of origin to make accurate
        determination of the distance between the earth and Moon.
 
 
  Orbital Science Experiments
  ===========================
    Investigations were also carried out from lunar orbit in the Apollo 14
    Command and Service Module.  Hand-held photography and telescopic
    selenodetic reference point studies were performed from the command
    module, and instruments operated from the Scientific Instrument Module
    (SIM) in the Service Module, comprising:
 
    - An S-Band Transponder Experiment designed to carefully track the CSM
      orbit and measure the lunar gravity field.
 
    - A Bistatic Radar Experiment used measurements of S-Band and VHF
      reflections to probe electromagnetic and structural properties of
      the lunar surface.
 
    Additional experiments were also performed in lunar orbit and during
    the cruise between Earth and Moon
 
    - The Gegenschein Photography Experiment took images of the
      reflections from dust particles at the Moulton point.
 
    - The Window Meteoroid experiment studied micrometeoroid impacts on
      the Apollo 14 Command Module heat shield windows to obtain
      information about the mass flux of micrometeorites.]]></field>

ROSETTA Mission Overview
=====================================================================
 
The ROSETTA mission is an interplanetary mission whose main
objectives are the rendezvous and in-situ measurements of the comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, scheduled for 2014/2015. The spacecraft
carries a Rosetta Lander, named Philae, to the nucleus and deploys it
onto its surface.
 
A brief description of the mission and its objectives can be found in
the Rosetta Science Management Plan [RO-EST-PL-0001] and in papers
[GLASSMEIERETAL2007A]. A detailed description of the
mission analysis can be found in the Consolidated Report on Mission
Analysis [RO-ESC-RP-5500], the ROSETTA User Manual [RO-DSS-MA-1001],
and the flight Operations Plan [RO-ESC-PL-5000].
 
On its long way to the comet nucleus after a Launch by Ariane 5 P1+
in March 2004, the ROSETTA spacecraft orbits the Sun for one year
until it returns to Earth for the first swing-by. The planet Mars is
reached in February 2007, about 3 years after launch. In November
2007 a second Earth swing-by takes place and a third one in November
2009. Two asteroid flybys (2867 Steins and 21 Lutetia) are performed
on the way to the comet. These two asteroids were selected at the
Science Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004 among all the
available candidate asteroids, depending on the scientific interest
and the propellant required for the correction manoeuvre. Around the
aphelion of its orbit, which is 5.3 AU from the Sun, the spacecraft
is in a spinning hibernation mode for about 2.5 years.
 
The comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is reached about 10.5 years after
launch, in May 2014. After a comet mapping phase the Surface Science
Package, carried piggyback on the spacecraft are released for landing
on the comet's surface for in situ measurements. The ROSETTA mission
then makes a detailed study of the comet and its environment until a
Sun distance of 2 AU is reached again after comet perihelion, at the
end of the year 2015.
 
Please note:
------------
The ROSETTA spacecraft was originally designed for a mission to the
comet 46 P/Wirtanen to be launched in January 2003. Due to a delay of
the launch a new comet (67P/Churyumow-Gerasimenko) had been selected
by the Science Working Team on 3rd-4th April 2003 [RO-SWT-2004APR04].
The compliance of the design was checked and where necessary adapted
for this new mission. Therefore in the following all the details and
characteristics for this new mission are used.
 
 
ROSETTA Mission Objectives
=====================================================================
 
The scientific objectives of the ROSETTA mission can be considered
from three main viewpoints:
 
First of all, comets and asteroids are fully-fledged members of our
solar system, which means, that they are objects of intrinsic
interest to planetary scientists. The level of investigations
conducted on these bodies is therefore far below that achieved for
the other objects of the solar system.
The study of the small solar-system bodies arguably represents the
last major gap in the tremendous worldwide effort that has been made
to reveal our planetary neighbours to us.
 
The most important scientific rationale for studying small solar-
system bodies is the key role-play in helping us to understand the
formation of the solar system. Comets and asteroids have a close
genetic relationship with the planetesimals, which formed from the
solar nebula 4.57 billion years ago. Most of our present
understanding of these processes has been obtained by studying
meteorites, which constitute a biased sample of asteroidal material,
and micrometeoroids, which may represent cometary grains processed by
solar radiation and atmospheric entry. There is therefore a strong
scientific case of studying cometary material in situ, as it is
surely more primitive than extraterrestrial samples.
 
A third scientific aspect is the study of the physio-chemical
processes, which are specific to comets and asteroids. In this
respect, asteroids can provide information on impact phenomena,
particularly on very large scale. However, the increase in cometary
activity as these bodies approach the Sun undoubtedly represents one
of the most complex and fascinating processes to be observed in the
solar system.
 
Science Objectives
---------------------
The prime scientific objectives as defined in the Announcement of
Opportunity [RO-EST-AO-0001] by the Rosetta Science Team can be
summarized as:
 
- Global characterisation of the nucleus, determination of dynamic
properties, surface morphology and composition
 
- Chemical, mineralogical and isotropic compositions of volatiles and
refractories in a cometary nucleus
 
- Physical properties and interrelation of volatiles and refractories
in a cometary nucleus
 
- Study of the development of cometary activity and the processes in
the surface layer of the nucleus and in the inner coma (dust-gas
interaction)
 
- Origin of comets, relationship between cometary and interstellar
material.
 
- Implications for the origin of the solar system
 
- Global characterisation of the asteroid, determination of dynamic
properties, surface morphology and composition.
 
 
Mission Profile
=====================================================================
 
The ROSETTA mission profile results from the orbit of the target
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which has a perihelion close to 1.2
AU and an aphelion of about 5.7 AU, resulting in a period of about
6.5 years. A detailed description of the Mission Profile can be found
in the Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis [RO-ESC-RP-5500], in
the Rosetta Mission Calendar [RO-ESC-PL-5026] and in the RSOC Design
Specification [RO-EST-PL-2010].
 
The injection of the spacecraft by a single Ariane 5 Launch with the
so-called 'delayed ignition' of the upper stage, is not directly into
the trajectory to the comet, because of the high spacecraft wet mass.
Therefore the spacecraft has to be accelerated by a sequence of
gravity assist manoeuvres at Mars and the Earth, in order to catch up
with the comet's velocity at perihelion. However, this increases the
mission duration to a total of nearly 12 years.
 
The initially large distance to the comet at the perihelion of its
trajectory is slowly decreasing after the third Earth swing-by. At
the intersection of both orbits, the difference in orbit inclination
and the residual relative velocity are diminished by the comet orbit
matching manoeuvre at around 4.0 AU Sun distance. The range of the
spacecraft-to-Sun distance is between 0.88 and 5.33 AU, defined by
the minimum Sun distance during the first five years of the mission
with the swing-bys at Earth, and the maximum Sun distance close to
the aphelion of the comet's orbit. The evolution of the spacecraft
distance to Earth over the mission time follows the profile of the
Sun distance superimposed by an oscillation with an amplitude of 2 AU
(+1,-1) and a period of about one year due to the Earth's motion
around the Sun. This results in a range from 0 AU (Earth Departure
and Swing-by) to 6.3 AU during the superior solar conjunction close
to the spacecraft's aphelion (see Solar Conjunctions section below).
 
After the second and third Earth swing-by ROSETTA crosses the
asteroid main belt, which gives the opportunity of two asteroid
flybys. The asteroids 2867 Steins and 21 Lutetia, are encountered on
5 September 2008 and 10 July 2010 respectively. These two asteroids
were selected at the Science Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004
among all the available candidate asteroids, depending on the
scientific interests and the propellant required for the correction
manoeuvre.
Between the major mission events, up to the comet rendezvous
manoeuvre, the spacecraft performs long interplanetary cruise phases
(up to 2.5 years) with several solar conjunctions (see Solar
Conjunctions section below) and the power critical aphelion passage
(last cruise phase). In order to reduce the ground segment costs and
the wear and tear of spacecraft equipment during these phases, the
spacecraft is put in 'Hibernation Mode'.
 
Two types of hibernation modes are planned to be used:
 
* 'Deep Space Hibernation Mode' above 4.5 AU: Inertial spin mode with
a spin rate of 4 deg/sec. The spacecraft is almost entirely passive,
except of receivers/ decoders, power supply, heaters and two
Processor Modules with one RTU.
 
* 'Near Sun Hibernation Mode' below 4.5 AU: 3-axes stabilised mode
with the solar arrays Sun-pointing and the +X-axis Earth-pointing.
Attitude control is performed with thrusters and star trackers, based
on ephemerides; occasional solar array adjustments and ground
contacts via the medium gain antenna (MGA).
 
The final approach to the comet into its sphere of influence is
prepared by the rendezvous manoeuvre (RVM-2), that matches the
spacecraft orbit with the comet orbit.
 
A subsequent sequence of approach manoeuvres, supported by optical
navigation, takes the spacecraft closer and closer to the comet.
After determination of the physical model of the comet by Doppler and
optical measurements, the spacecraft is inserted into a global
mapping orbit around the comet.
 
The global mapping starts from orbital heights of 5 to 25 comet
radii, depending on the actual size, shape and mass of the comet.
Close observation of specific landmarks from altitudes down to one
comet radius is planned. At least 80% of the illuminated surface
shall be mapped. The very low velocity of the spacecraft in the comet
orbit (few cm/s) requires a high performance accuracy of the
propulsion system.
 
The delivery of the Lander or Surface Science Package (SSP) is
achieved from an eccentric orbit, which takes the spacecraft to a low
altitude above the selected landing site. The Lander release is fully
automatic according to a predefined schedule, and shall lead to touch
down with minimum vertical and horizontal velocities relative to the
local rotating surface. Upon the landing of the Lander, the
spacecraft provides uplink and downlink data relay between the Lander
and the Earth.
 
After the Lander delivery the ROSETTA spacecraft escorts the comet
until the perihelion passage and outwards again, until a Sun distance
of 2 AU is reached end of the year 2015. The main scientific
objective during this phase is the monitoring of the features of the
active comet.

Payload Checkouts
-----------------
Payload checkouts are scenarios designed to allow Rosetta payload to
make regular health checks, to activate mechanisms and to monitor
trends through calibration tests. They are allocated in the mission
calendar at regular 6-month periods during the first 10 years of the
mission cruise phase. They are split into passive and active payload
checkouts. Passive payload checkouts are entirely non-interactive.
Conditions for the passive checkout are that it will:
a) not require any real time monitoring, b) run entirely off of MTL,
c) not require s/c specific pointing other than to maintain listed
constraints, d) produce minimal science data. Active payload checkout
operations are executed both interactively and non-interactively .
Conditions for the active checkout are that it will: a) limit the
requirement for real time monitoring, b) run mostly from MTL, c) limit
the requirement for s/c specific pointing beyond maintaining listed
constraints, d) produce minimal science data. There is more
flexibility during active checkouts and in addition payloads use
interactive passes to make any necessary memory patches and tests.

Solar Conjunctions/Oppositions
-------------------------------
Other mission phases, which result from the orbit geometry and
interfere with the above operational phases, are the solar
conjunctions. Two types of conjunctions occur throughout the mission:
 
* Solar Oppositions: The Earth is between spacecraft and Sun,
resulting in a degradation of the command link to the spacecraft.
 
* Superior Solar Conjunctions: Sun is between spacecraft and Earth,
resulting in a degradation of the command and telemetry link to/from
the spacecraft.
 
Table below shows the solar conjunction phases throughout the mission
with type, begin and duration of the conjunction and correspondant
mission phase. The phases are defined as the periods, during which
the Sun-SpaceCraft-Earth (SSCE) angle is below 5 degrees.

Mission Phases Description
=====================================================================
 
Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP)
-----------------------------
Rosetta was launched by an Ariane 5/G+ in a dedicated flight (single
launch configuration) from Kourou at 07:17:51 UTC 2 March 2004. After
burnout of the lower composite, the upper stage together with the
spacecraft remained in an eccentric coast arc for nearly 2 hours.
Then the upper stage performed delayed ignition and injected the
Rosetta spacecraft into the required escape hyperbola.
 
After spacecraft separation from the upper stage, Rosetta acquires
its three axes stabilised Sun pointing attitude and deploys the solar
arrays autonomously. Ground operations acquire the down-link in
S-band using the ESA network and control the spacecraft to a fine-
pointing attitude with the HGA pointing towards Earth using X-band
telemetry. Tracking and orbit determination are performed, the
departure trajectory is verified and corrected by the on-board
propulsion system of the spacecraft.
 
The launch locks of the Lander Philae are released at the end of the
first ground station pass. Philae remains firmly attached to the
spacecraft by the cruise latches until its release at the comet.
 
Commissioning phase (1 and 2)
-------------------
Commissioning starts three days after launch following the first
trajectory correction manoeuvre. A Deep Space Manouver (DSM1) of 173
m/s is executed at perihelion. All spacecraft functions needed during
the cruise to the comet, in particular for hibernation, are checked
and the scientific payload is commissioned.
 
Commissioning is done in two parts, as the New Norcia ground station
must be shared with Mars Express and cannot be used by Rosetta from
June to mid-September 2004.
 
For more information refer to the following reports:
[RO-EST-RP-3293] Consolidated Rosetta Payload Report of the Mission
Commissioning Results Review
[RO-EST-RP-3307] RSOC_Commissioning_Results_Report_2005Dec19.pdf
[RO-EST-RP-3343] Interference Scenario Report
 
Cruise phase 1
--------------
Almost all the scientific instruments, except ALICE are switched off
while ground contact is practically not available. No payload
operations are done during this phase.
 
Earth swing-by 1
----------------
The actual Earth swing-by takes place on 4-Mar-05. The phase ends one
month after the swing-by and the spacecraft is prepared for the next
cruise phase to Mars.
One passive Payload Checkout is scheduled end of March 2005.
Immediately after this flyby an Asteroid Flyby Mode Simulation is
performed using the Moon as a target. Some limited payload operations
are permitted shortly before during and shortly after this Earth
Flyby. Rosetta payload teams are given the opportunity to conduct
scientific investigation that includes close approach of both the
Earth and the Moon and the AFM simulation. Any activities that do not
require the Earth-Moon system i.e. continued instrument commissioning,
are considered for later in the Mission, such as during the next
active checkout.
 
The instrument objectives are listed below.
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE objectives are:
    - Flat field calibration
    - Extended object scattered light calibration (Moon as the target)
    - Absolute solar calibration
    - Absolute flux and wavelength calibration (wide part of the slit
    to take in the Moon)
    - Door performance test due to anomalies raised during
    commissioning
 
  MIRO
    - Asteroid Flyby Simulation test
    - H2O lines in Earth (high quality data obtained but analysis not
    complete)
    - Radiometric calibration of the Moon
 
  RPC
    - Sensor calibration
    - Magnetospheric physics
    - Verification of the science operations modes for the Mars flyby
 
  RSI
    - HGA to Earth around closest approach to Moon
 
  OSIRIS
    - Because of technical issues OSIRIS was not operated during the
    Earth Swing-By itself.
 
 
  VIRTIS
    - Co-alignment M/H
    - Aldebaran target in IR (failed, boresight did not detect the
    target)
    - Absolute calibration using the Moon
    - Full disc Earth imaging including exosphere over one rotation
 
LANDER
 
  CIVA
    - Earth Picture with Camera #2 or 4
 
  ROMAP with RPC MAG
    - magnetic axes alignment of sensors with Earth magnetic field
    - Checking of scaled values with known Earth values
    - Solar wind values comparison with other s/c
 
 
Problems:
 
  RPC
    - Loss of LAP science data for 41.5 hours (2005-03-01 19:00 --
    2005-04-03 12:30).

Cruise phase 2 (and Deep Impact)
--------------------------------
After leaving the Earth, the spacecraft makes one revolution around
the Sun, and in the second arc from perihelion to aphelion makes a
swing-by of Mars.
 
There is a solar conjunction for more than one month in April 2006
(see Solar Conjunctions section above). Two passive check-outs with
non-interactive instrument operations for about 5 days are scheduled
during the cruise to Mars. PC1 occurs from 5/09/2005 to 5/10/2005. PC2
takes place from 3/03/2006 to 8/03/2006.
 
The NASA Deep Impact mission encounters comet 9P/Tempel 1 on 4 July
2005, which falls into the Cruise 2 mission phase. At around 06:00
UTC, the mother probe sends a 362 kg impactor into the nucleus with a
relative speed of 10.2 km/s. Rosetta is in a privileged position for
its remote sensing instruments to observe the event (80 million km
distance, 90 degrees angle respect to the sun). Rosetta monitors
Tempel 1 continuously (i.e. 24 hrs per day) over an extended period
from 7 days before the deep impact to 11 days afterwards (27Jun-15Jul
2005). The first 2 days ALICE observe the stars for calibration. From
the 28th June to the 15th July, OSIRIS, ALICE, and MIRO operate
observing comet 9P/Tempel 1 continuously. VIRTIS was on only several
hours around the impact. Maintenance activities were carried out for
COSIMA, ROSINA, ALICE.
 
During the Deep Impact subphase, the instruments have the following
objectives:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Baseline pre-impact spectrum. Comparison with near and long
    term post impact spectra. The comet is detected in all spectra.
    - Strong atomic lines of neutral H and O were detected throughout
    the observation period.
    - Two weak lines of neutral C detected on some dates. No change
    detected by ALICE in comet's UV spectrum as a result of impact
    - except for possible enhancement in C emission.
    - No evidence of Ar, S, N, CO.
    - Water production rates. Results TBC.
    - Dark histograms.
    - Calibration star before the encounter. Spectra of calibration
    star is used for calibration of the Deep Impact spectra and
    instrument sensitivity. The data is also used to look for any
    flux variations due to pointing/jitter (initial results do not
    show any evidence of significant fluctuations in the stellar
    count rate).
    - Memory patch (time synchronisation issue).
 
  MIRO
    - Changes in the coma composition induced by the impact.
    - Upper limit on the water production rate in the pre-impact
    phase of the experiment. Water production rate and albeit
    with low signal-to-noise measured in the post impact phase. The
    water production rate is less than has been anticipated based
    on models.
    - Detection of carbon monoxide: the analysis is not complete but
    so far no CO was detected.
    - Estimate of Doppler velocity.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Accurate photometry of the unresolved nucleus (no atmosphere in
    between) with complete time coverage. The time resolution is
    better than a minute around the impact and can draw conclusion
    about the evolution of the impact cloud during the first hour.
    The long term monitoring allowed determination of the composition
    and evolution of the impact cloud (water production and dust/ice
    ratio)
    - UV coverage that allowed imaging of the OH emission at 308nm
    (estimate of the water production by the impact)
    - Imaging of the coma out to at least 150000km from the nucleus.
    The effect of the impact can be seen in the images for
    appromximately a week (stereo reconstruction of coma,
    impact cloud).
 
  VIRTIS
    - Coma and ejecta composition and temporal evolution. But the
    outburst due to the impact was not energetic enough to reach the
    minimum sensitivity required.
 
Conclusions of the Deep Impact Observations:
 
The science objectives of the Deep Impact Observations scenario are
met. The brightness increase of Tempel 1 produced by the impact is
lower than we had hoped for, and as a result the comet was too weak to
be detected by VIRTIS. For ALICE and MIRO the signal was just above
the sensitivity limit, but nevertheless important measurements could
be achieved. The results of OSIRIS even exceeded the expectations, and
the first scientific publications are widely cited. The data collected
by the experiments on board Rosetta are unique because Tempel 1 was
monitored continuously over an extended period of time (no day-and-
night cycle in contrast to ground-based telescopes) and in the absence
of an absorbing atmosphere.
 
The following operations have been done during the Passive checkout 1:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Electronic and software
    - Test pattern and stim test
    - Memory check
    - dark exposures
    There is no instrument anomalies. The door performance test showed
    nominal behavior.
 
  CONSERT
    - Consert Orbiter verification
    - Consert Lander verification
    - Consert Orbiter/Lander time synchronisation
 
  COSIMA
    - Self check
    - Target manipulator unit maintenance
    - Ion emitter maintenance
 
  GIADA
    - Run mechanisms - cover operations
    - Health check (all subsystems, electronics, noise and
    contamination monitoring, performances estimation)
 
  MIDAS
    - Exercising of all mechanisms (shutter, approach mechanism,
    linear stage, wheel, scanner)
    The test is successful and MIDAS is fully operable.
 
  MIRO
    - Regular exercise and health check of all commands in all modes
    - Regular dump of EEPROM memory to check for radiation damage.
    All objectives are met. There is no radiation damage of the
    EEPROM.
 
  RPC
    - MAG: instrument calibration. Undisturbed solar wind is measured
    to calibrate the offsets of the MAG instrument in quiet conditions
    (Hedgecock method).
    - LAP: instrument calibration.
    - MIP: Instrument checkout
    - IES: measurement in the undisturbed solar wind for calibration
    of its sensors and cross calibration with LAP.
    The PC operations are completed successfully with no change in
    instrument performance for MAG and IES.
 
  RSI
    Two frequency downlink drven by the USO and a ground station
    that can receive the X and S band signals.
    - Investigate the stability of the USO
    - Verify interaction with the ground
    Investigations of the USO data from PC#0 revealed that the
    behaviour of the USO is obviously not as good as it was during
    the last USO test in October.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Exercise the instrument mechanisms
    - Verify the sanity of the CCD
    - Verify the focus
    No anomaly occurs.
 
 
LANDER
  Test of the Lander Platform overall performance
  Secondary battery monitoring
  Lander extended AFT
  CDMS EEPROM dump
  functional test for
    PTOLEMY
    CONSERT
 
The following operations have been done during the Passive checkout 2:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - same health tests as PC1. Tests successful.
 
  CONSERT
    - same as PC1. Tests generally successful (see report)
 
  COSIMA
    - self check of all hardware sub-systems on operational voltage
    levels
    - target manipulator unit checkout
    - maintenance COSISCOPE checkout
    - emitter maintenance
    Tests generally successful.
 
  GIADA
    - Same as PC1 plus monitoring of MBS coating evolution.
    The cover operations went fine. There is no further contamination
    of the microbalances. GDS is not fully tested for light
    conditions. IS seems nominal. All HK values are as expected.
 
  MIDAS
    - same as PC1. Tests are successful.
 
  MIRO
    - Same as PC1. Overall success.
 
  RPC
    - Same as PC1. All performances checked are nominal.
 
  RSI
    - Same as PC1. The USO behaves very good, USO drift satisfactory.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Same as PC1. Generally successful. For solar elongation
    angles < 90 degrees OSIRIS gets substantial scattered light
    through the nominally closed doors. The scattered light observed
    during PC2 was unfortunately enough that parts of the CCD surface
    was saturated. This happened in spite of the large exposure time
    reduction that was made after PC1.
 
  VIRTIS
    - The check done were performed properly.
 
LANDER
  Same as PC1 plus functional tests for
    MUPUS

Mars swing-by
-------------
The mission phase begins two months before DSM2 of 65 m/s, which is
performed near perihelion. The actual Mars swing-by takes place on
25-Feb-07. The minimum altitude with respect to the Martian surface
is 200 km. The relative approach and departure velocity is 8.8 km/s.
During the swing-by a communications black-out of approximately 14
min is expected due to occultation of the spacecraft by Mars.
Furthermore the spacecraft is expected to be in eclipse for about 24
min. The phase ends one month after DSM3. DSM3 of 129 m/s is scheduled
near the aphelion of this arc in order to obtain the proper arrival
conditions at the Earth. Two passive payload check-outs of about 5
days and an active longer one of 25 days are scheduled during the
phase.
 
PC3 starts on 25th August 2006 and ends 30th August 2006.
The following operations were planed during PC3. GIADA and ROSINA did
not take part in this PC.

    Such data will be used to calibrate the offsets of the MAG
    instrument in quiet conditions (Hedgecock method).
    - LAP: Instrument calibration.
    - MIP: Instrument checkout.
    - IES: measurements in the undisturbed solar wind for calibration
    of its sensors and crosscalibration with LAP.
 
  RSI
    - Investigate the stability of the USO and verify interaction
    with the ground.
    The PC3 results are very promising and the behavior of the USO
    is as good as expected. The stability of the USO is still one
    order of magnitude better than anticipated before launch.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Instrument mechanisms, verify the sanity of the CCD, verify the
    focus of the instrument.
 
  VIRTIS
    - Both VIRTIS M and H are working as expected.
    - PC3 has been used to verify the upload of a new pixel map for
    VIRTIS-H to be used during the forthcoming PC4 (pixel map allows
    to drastically reduce the data volume).
 
LANDER
  - Test of the Lander platform to check the overall performance and
  Secondary Battery Status
  - Lander Extended AFT with short function

Cruise phase 3
--------------
No check-outs are scheduled during the short cruise to Earth.
 
Earth swing-by 2
----------------
Daily operations start again around two months before Rosetta reaches
Earth with tracking and navigation manoeuvres. The actual Earth swing
-by takes place on 13-Nov-07. The perigee altitude is 13890 km. The
relative approach and departure velocity is 9.3 km/s. The phase ends
one month after the LGA strobing phase. In this phase the spacecraft
gets very close to the sun (min distance 0.91AU). One 15 day payload
checkout and one 5 day payload checkout are also scheduled in this
phase.

Cruise phase 4 (split into 4-1 and 4-2)
--------------
In this phase the spacecraft makes one revolution around the Sun.
. A solar
conjunction takes place in January 2009 (see Solar Conjunctions
section above), together with another two conjunctions of the Earth-
spacecraft- Sun angle (Sun-Earth conjunction as seen from the
spacecraft). In this phase the spacecraft gets very close to the sun
(min distance 0.91AU). This Cruise phase has been splitted in two
parts after the selection of the first Asteroid flyby which falls
in the middle of this phase. Cruise 4-1 is before the flyby phase,
and 4-2 is right after. Two passive check-outs are scheduled, one
during Cruise 4-1 and the second one during Cruise 4-2.
 
During this phase, occured

Steins flyby
-------------
Asteroid Steins was the first dedicated scientific target of the
Rosetta mission. Closest approach was on 5 September 2008 at 18:38:22
UTC. Rosetta flew at 800 km from asteroid Steins. For the first time a
European spacecraft flew next to an asteroid, performed an optical
navigation campaign, and autonomously tracked the asteroid by means of
its on board camera.
 
The 2867 Steins E-type asteroid had been discovered on 4 November 1969
by N. Chernykh. Its dimensions have been estimated by [KELLERETAL2010]
to 6.67 x 5.81 x 4.47 km3, corresponding to a spherical equivalent
radius of 2.65 km. Its sideral rotation period has been estimated to
6.04681 +/- 0.00002h, its pole direction in ecliptic coordinates to
approximately Lambda = 250 deg and Beta = -89 deg with an error of
about 5 degrees [LAMYETAL2008]. Its albedo has been estimated to 0.3
in the visible and 0.4 in the infrared, both by [KELLERETAL2010] and
[LAMYETAL2008].
 
The two asteroids Rosetta flew by are secondary science targets of the
Rosetta mission, with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko being the
primary science target. Therefore, scientific measurements of Asteroid
(2867) Steins had highest priority during the Steins flyby.
Calibrations was performed during the flyby phase only if a
calibration close in time to the actual scientific measurement was
needed.
 
The flyby geometry necessitated a flip in the spacecraft attitude
before closest approach. As a compromise between the incompatible
requirements to minimize the illumination of the -X and +-Y panels of
the spacecraft (flip as late as possible) and to minimize the impact
on the science observations (flip as early as possible), the
spacecraft flip was performed between 40 and 20 minutes before closest
approach. The flyby of Steins is a very fast flyby in the sense that
the distance between Rosetta and the Asteroid changes by an order of
magnitude within 15 minutes before and after the flyby.
 
The heliocentric and geocentric distances of Rosetta during the Steins
flyby was 2.14 AU and 2.41 AU, respectively. The one way light travel
time were 20 minutes.
 
The estimated accuracy of the determination of the position of Steins
in the plane perpendicular to the flight direction during the naviga-
-tion campaign was +/-2 kms for navigation with OSIRIS and +/-16 kms
for navigation with the NAVCAMs (from navigation slot on Sept. 4). For
the targeted passage through phase angle 0 at a distance of 1280 kms
from Steins, a positional offset of 2 kms would correspond to a
minimum phase angle of 0.1 degree.

  Summary results per instrument during closest approach:
    ALICE: Beginning 7 minutes before CA, ALICE made a 10 minute
    histogram observation of the asteroid. The spectrum extracted
    from this histogram observation is the first of an asteroid
    below 200nm and has an excellent signal to noise ratio. The
    observed count rate from Steins was about a factor of two larger
    than predicted. The spectrum of Steins is similar both to the
    spectrum of the Earth's moon obtained during ESB2, and the solar
    spectrum. During CA, Alice recorded the total count rate of the
    detector at a rate of once per second. This data will be used to
    derive a FUV phase curve for the asteroid; this analysis is
    currently under way. There are two spikes in the observed count
    rate, one slightly before passing through zero phase and the
    other centered at the time Rosetta passed through zero phase. It
    was initially thought that this second spike might represent an
    opposition surge. However, subsequent analysis using the
    reconstructed attitude information revealed that the two spikes
    are actually due to the apparent motion of the multiple star
    Rho Oph as Rosetta was tracking the asteroid: the initial spike
    is caused by the star gazing the wide top part of the Alice slit,
    the second spike is caused by the star grazing the wide bottom
    part of the slit, and the gap between the spikes is caused by the
    star lying outside of field of view of the narrow center segment
    of the slit.
 
    MIRO: the instrument was on during approximately 10 hours around
    CA. The instrument was operated in three modes: a)spectroscopic-
    dual continuum mode, b) dual continuum mode, and c)asteroid mode.
    High signal-to-noise responses to Steins were seen in both
    continuum channels, however the responses were of short duration
    (minutes), because of the s/c pointing. Near closest approach,
    the submillimeter beam boresight was located approximately on the
    limb of Steins, rather than near the center of Steins. As a
    result of the mis-pointing, phase coverage was severely limited.
    No spectral features were visible in the individual spectrum
    data. A preliminary study to search for water by integrating
    multiple spectra was carried out, but no spectral line of water
    was detected. The immediate plans are to compare the (dual
    frequency) continuum data with thermal models of Steins. For this
    purpose, both the reconstructed pointing data, and a (projected
    area) shape model for Steins are needed. Using the IR surface
    temperature maps provided by VIRTIS, the goal is to derive a
    subsurface temperature gradient, and the loss tangent of the
    regolith material. It is planned to continue the effort to detect
    or set an upper limit on the water abundance around Steins. The
    full spectrum will also be examined to search for other molecules.
 
    LANDER/ROMAP: ROMAP worked perfectly and all HK values are in the
    expected range. Magnetic field measurements were disturbed by
    MUPUS supply current. All the measured signatures were spacecraft
    generated. The magnetic field measurement showed that Steins does
    not interact significantly (>nT) with the solar wind. The global
    magnetization of Steins has to be therefore less than 1mAm2/kg.
    For the first time both magnetometers (ROMAP-MAG and RPC-MAG)
    worked in parallel doing a true interference test.
 
    LANDER/SESAME: The flyby at asteroid (2867) Steins and its
    observation on 5 September 2008 required an attitude change that
    moved Philae out of the orbiter shadow for about half an hour.
    This circumstance was used to obtain calibration measurements for
    the new CASSE temperature measuring method. CASSE listenings were
    used to investigate the vibration background caused by the orbiter
    reacion wheels (RW). It was found that part of the backgound
    vibration is not caused by the RW but other orbiter units or
    experiment. In addition, new possible harmonics of the RW have
    been identified.
 
    LANDER/MUPUS: MUPUS was continuously operated for 17h around CA,
    starting 7h before CA. During the heating period, a current of
    about 100 mA was drawn from the +12V line which disturbed the
    ROMAP measurements during the flyby. There were differences in
    temperature measurements between ANC-T and TCU sensors. It seems
    that a loss of sensitivity by about 28% compared to the ground
    calibration occurred in the MUPUS TM sensors (TBC during descent
    to comet).
 
    ROSINA: COPS was switched on to the highest sensitivity with both
    gauges. The COPS pressure is normally transmitted in the
    housekeeping, one value every minute. One hour before to one houre
    after CA COPS transmitted science data with a pressure value every
    2 s. There is clearly a peak at closest approach.
    DFMS was switch on in an outgassing mode. The sensor gave error
    during CA due to the cold temperatude of the LEDA. Nevertheless,
    DFMS produced excellent scientific data. The oxygen peak measured
    by DFMS was much more pronounced during the closest approach than
    during normal background measurements. However, the S/C flip also
    produced a high oxygen peak and it remains to be seen what amount
    of oxygen can be attributed to the S/C water and what to the
    Steins exosphere. This needs modelling with the Rosetta S/C model.
    An interesting feature has been seen during the S/C flip: the COPS
    pressure rises much more rapidly than the DFMS oxygen signal. This
    means that the first gas sublimating from the S/C is probably not
    water but a molecule which does not contain oxygen. This is also
    compatible with the fact that COPS measured a much higher pressure
    peak during the flip than during CA whereas for the oxygen of DFMS
    both peaks have similar amplitudes.
    The table below summarizes the ROSINA switch on/off:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Date   | Time  |
    2/09/08| 06:00 | On: Outgassing mode
    4/09/08| 18:00 | Calib and asteroid mode
    5/09/08| 06:00 | Stand by and OFF
    5/09/08| 15:45 | On
    6/09/08| 05:00 | Stand by
    6/09/08| 18:00 | OFF
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    The general conclusion is that COPS and DFMS delivered good
    scientific data despite the DFMS issue. Outgassing of the s/c is a
    problem and has to be taken into account for all operations near
    the comet.
 
    RPC/ICA: ICA was not turned on in the appropriate mode (human
    error) so no data was taken.
    RPC/IES: IES operation during the flyby was nominal although no
    indication of material from the asteroid was seen. RPC IES was
    able to estimate solar wind velocity.
    RPC/LAP: LAP operations were nominal in the entire period of
    operations. The photoemission level was as small as expected (15
    nA) due to the large heliocentric distance (around 2 AU). The
    results (variations in the time series) are still under
    investigation.
 
    RPC/MAG: RPC MAG was switch on between 2008-09-01T00:10:00 and
    2008-09-10T06:01:00. The spectra of the magnetic field data
    measured by the OB sensor show, as usual, an influence of ROSETTAs
    reaction wheels when in Burstmode. The data of the flyby are
    disturbed by pulsed MUPUS heater currents. The currents generate
    magnetic disturbances in the order of 2nT (100nT at the location
    of the ROMAP sensors). The comparision between IB and OB data
    showed that the measurements are very sensitive to specific
    temperature changes at the single sensors. All flyby data are very
    disturbed. Disturbances occur in various time scales. The origin
    of the disturbance cannot clearly be identified (MUPUS?). Rotation
    of the solar array and movement of the HGA cannot be seen in the
    magnetic field data. Any signature of Steins cannot be seen in the
    magnetic field data.
    RPC/MIP: Very low values of MIP sensor temperatures are observed,
    affecting the electronics and MIP response. Interferences are
    observed in the whole frequency range when the temperature is
    particularly low (around -150 degrees). The apparition of these
    interferences is clearly correlated with the satellite manoeuvres.
    Nominal temperatures and spectra are obtained in favorable
    attitude configuration. LDL mode in Normal rate is affected due to
    the lack of emission in this period (to be
    confirmed/investigated). No plasma signature has been observed
    during the STEINS flyby.
 
    VIRTIS: TBW
 
    RSI: The Earth was tracked by the High-gain antenna for most of
    the time around the Steins flyby. However, it was known beforehand
    that a mass determination of the small asteroid Steins would not
    be possible.
 
    SREM: SREM was on during the Steins flyby in its usual
    accumulation mode, but did not perform any Steins specific
    operations.

    GIADA: TBW (the report has not been provided by the team)
 
    COSIMA: After the instrument power on 20080901, the highlevel task
    to image one of the D8 substrates was started. The TMU started
    from its initial position to grasp the D8 target holder from its
    exposed location in the COSIMA dust funnel. The TMU generated an
    error event during the grasping action and stopped any further
    COSIMA command execution. After the operator reported of the error
    to the COSIMA team, all the remaining operations were cancelled
    and COSIMA was left switched on. On the following day, 20080902,
    the COSIMA instrument was shutdown.
 
The Rosetta first asteroid flyby was a success. The navigation
campaign produced highly accurate predictions of the Steins position,
and during the flyby most instruments worked without serious problems.
Asteroid flyby mode worked well, although with somewhat lower tracking
accuracy than expected.

Earth swing-by 3
----------------
Operations are essentially the same as for the Earth swing-by 2. The
actual Earth swing-by takes place in Nov-09. The perigee altitude is
300 km. The relative approach and departure velocity is 9.9 km/s.
Phase starts 3 months before the swing-by and ends 1 month later. Two
short payload checkouts of about 5 days each are scheduled during
this phase.
 
The phase contains the Active Payload Checkout 10 (PC10). This section
will first describe PC 10 and then the Earth Flyby.
 
  PC10
  ----
  The Active PC10 ran for 18 consecutive days from 18th September 2009
  to 4th October 2009. It represented a target independent opportunity
  to perform interactive operations and to request spacecraft
  pointing. All payloads took part in this scenario, as interactive
  or non-interactive operations. There were approximately 425 hours of
  non-interactive and 68 hours of interactive operations. Four
  instruments required active s/c pointing with 15 targets observed
  (111 hours of dedicated s/c pointing). These were mostly for
  calibration purposes.

Cruise phase 5
--------------
One Active checkout (12) was scheduled during this cruise phase.
It can be noted that Passive Checkout 11 were cancelled since there
was not enough time to include it between PC10 and PC12. PC 11 is
passive meaning that it is mainly instrument healthcheck operations.
PC 10 and 12 are active and more important to preserve.
 
 
Lutetia Flyby  (17/05/2010 - 03/09/2010)
--------------
The second of the flybys took place on 10 July 2010 to the asteroid
21 Lutetia, discovered on 15 November 1852 by H. Goldschmidt. Its
classification into a specific asteroid type had turned out to be
ambiguous and included the possibilities of a C-type or an M-type
asteroid. This contradiction made it an interesting object for close
inspection.
Closest Approach (CA) occurred at 15:45 UT at a distance of 3168.2km.
The relative fly-by velocity was of 15 km/s. The fly-by strategy
allowed continuous observations of Lutetia before, during and for 30
minutes after CA.
Images obtained by OSIRIS revealed that Lutetia has a complex geology
and one of the highest asteroid densities measured so far,
3.4+/-0.3g/cm3. Its geologically complex surface, ancient surface age
and high density suggest that Lutetia is most likely a primordial
planetesimal.
This is the second of the two asteroids selected at the Science
Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004 among all the available
candidate asteroids, depending on the scientific interests and the
propellant required for the correction manoeuvre.
 
The following operations took place around the Lutetia fly-by:
21 May 2010 - 9 July 2010: Navigation campaign (astrometry) using the
OSIRIS NAC and NAVCAM.
5 July 2010- 14 July 2010: scientific operations targeting the
asteroid.
The Lutetia fly-by was a success. The navigation campaign produced
highly accurate predictions of the position of Lutetia and during
the fly-by most instruments worked without serious problems (except
Rosina, RPC IES and RPC ICA). Asteroid fly-by mode worked excellently.
The objectives summarised below have been addressed by the instrument
measurements:
  - Physical and thermal properties, mineralogy and geomorphology of
    Lutetia from spatially resolved multi-wavelengths remote-sensing
    observations between the extreme UV and the mm-range.
  - Determination of the mass of the asteroid from Doppler
    measurements of the spacecraft trajectory.
  - Global shape parameters from light curves taken days before CA.
  - Search for satellite/dust particles.
  - Search for an asteroid magnetic field.
  - Particle and field measurements.
The following summarises the observations and results per instrument:
ALICE
  - Surface reflectance, albedo, colour, light curve by
    spectrophotometry.
  - Surface composition by UV spectroscopy.
  - Asteroid exosphere search by UV spectroscopy: none detected
  - Alice optics decontamination before shutdown.
  - Standard stellar flux calibration using the Alice narrow center
    boresight
  - Standard stellar flux calibration using the Alice -X wide bottom
    boresight
  - Standard stellar flux calibration using the Alice +X wide top
    boresight
  - Dark exposures
  - Boresight cross-calibration with Osiris
  - Background
COSIMA
  - D8 substrates exposure: operational test, no asteroid dust
    identified.
  - All images were technically as expected.
PHILAE
  - ROMAP: no magnetic field detected at CA +/- 30 min
  - PTOLEMY: exosphere search (Sniff mode) [ANDREWSETAL2011]
  - COSAC: Verify mass spectrometer performance, characterise
    (spacecraft) gas environment, exosphere search.
MIDAS
  - Dust search: Target exposure was as expected and dust collector
    facet scan: as expected.
MIRO
  - Exosphere search by microwave (water).
  - Thermal properties by IR and sub-mm observations.
  - Observation of Lutetia during approach
  - Run asteroid mode sequence at CA
  - Observation of Lutetia during recession, includes slew to measure
    southern regions that are in seasonal night
  - Run asteroid mode sequence on dark sky.
ROSINA [ALTWEGGETAL2012]
DFMS and COPS were switched off before closest approach due to
software issue. However, RTOF provided excellent mass spectra.
The data gained during the Lutetia rehearsal are valuable in
distinguishing between spacecraft outgassing and real exosphere data.
  - DFMS: Outgassing
  - DFMS: Spacecraft background measurement
  - RTOF: Outgassing measurement. Signal was detected at CA. The cause
    ( Asteroid exosphere or spacecraft outgassing) is under
    investigation.
RPC
  - Sensor calibration and magnetospheric physics studies (IES and
    ICA software issues)
  - IES: solar wind proton measurements.
  - LAP: observe the solar wind and look for any signatures that
    may relate to asteroid-solar wind to interaction. Determine
    photoemission at large heliocentric distance. Results gave no
    immediately striking signature of asteroid interaction (could be
    revealed in a full analysis).
  - MAG: Reaction wheel influence and the disturbance of the LAP
    instrument can be seen. Comparison between IB and OB showed that
    the measurements are very sensitive to specific temperature
    changes at the single sensors. The flyby data are disturbed most
    of the time. The magnetic impact of Lutetia is less than 1 nT at
    the fly-by distance of 3120km (maximum magnetic dipole moment
    1x10e12 Am2).
  - MIP: same features than for Steins. No plasma signature is
    observed for the Lutetia fly-by. MIP electronics and response
    are affected by low values of sensor temperatures.
  - ICA: Soon after the switch on before Lutetia encounter, the
    temperature of the sensor quickly rose and the instrument was
    automatically powered off.
 
RSI
  - Mass of Lutetia was accurately determined.
OSIRIS
  - Stellar calibration using Vega Stare and 16 Cyg
  - Lutetia lightcurve at CA-80 hours
  - Lutetia observations at CA: Shape, global properties,
    geomorphology, surface composition obtained [THOMASETAL2012,
    MASSIRONIETAL2012, CREMONESEETAL2012, KUPPERSETAL2012,
    VINCENTETAL2011]
  - Support Alice boresight determination
  - Exosphere search by Filter imaging (OH, Na)
VIRTIS
  - Lutetia spectral light curve determination successful
  - Lutetia mineralogic mapping successful during and after CA
  - Thermal properties by Spectrophotometry
SREM
  - On during flyby in its usual accumulation mode but did not
    perform any Lutetia specific operations.

Rendez-Vous Manouver 1   (04/09/2010 - 13/07/2011)
----------------------
The deep space manoeuvre is carried out when the spacecraft has
reached a distance from the Sun around 4.5 AU on 23-Jan-11. One
passive check-out (13) is scheduled during this phase. One solar
conjunction of 50 days and one solar opposition of 37 days happen
during this phase.(see Solar Conjunctions section above).
--PC 13 (1st-9th Dec 2010 + 14th Dec)
This is the final Cruise Phase Checkout. A number of additional
payload operations were also executed, to close out pending and
essential requirements, and/or to configure instruments for the
upcoming Deep Space Hibernation Phase. Only OSIRIS did not participate
in PC 13. PC13 ran for 9 consecutive days between 1st and 9th December
2010. A RSI passive checkout was also completed on 14th December.
All of the operations planned and executed were successful. Minor
issues were observed by 4 instruments (Consert, Philae, Rosina, RPC).
Alice performed succesfully some instrument checkout.
Cosima did periodical maintenance and check its status.
Giada checked successfully its status.
Midas performed a normal passive check-out and an additional modified
one for Deep Space Hibernation Preparation.
Miro performed a normal and sucessful passive check-out.
Osiris did not participate in the PC13 timeframe. However, on 23-26th
March 2011 - post RVM1 - specific OSIRIS operations were performed in
order to prepare and configure the instrument for the Rosetta Deep
Space Hibernation.
The Lander performed some operations and Consert performed an unit
functional test; both were partially successful.

several specific operations immediately following completion of the
nominal PC13 timeline. A spacecraft slew was executed with RTOF
monitoring, to further investigate data observed during Lutetia
fly-by.

Cruise phase 6
--------------
The whole period is spent in Deep-Space Hibernation Mode (DSHM).
Maximum distances to Sun and Earth are encountered during this
period, i.e. 5.3 AU (aphelion) and 6.3 AU, respectively. During this
phase, 3 superior solar conjuctions and 2 solar oppositions occur
(see table above).
 
Rendez-Vous Manouver 2
----------------------
Not yet occured.
 
Near comet drift (NCD) phase
----------------------------
The spacecraft reaches the comet on 22-May-14 at a distance of 4.0 AU
from the Sun. A sequence of four rendezvous manoeuvres within 30 days
reduce the relative velocity with respect to the comet from 780 m/s
to 50 m/s. The spacecraft is in active cruise mode. During this phase
Rosetta approaches the comet without observing the comet with the
navigation camera (NAVCAM). The comet orbit is determined by a
dedicated ground-based astrometric observation campaign. The errors
in the estimated position of the comet can still be several tens of
thousand km. The final point of the NCD phase is the Comet
acquisition point (CAP) at 100000 km distance from the comet. The
selection of this position depends on two factors: avoiding cometary
debris (assuming there is any), and achieving good comet illumination
conditions.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Approach phase
--------------
 
-> Far Approach Trajectory (FAT)
Far-approach trajectory operations start at CAP. During this phase
the first images of the comet are obtained with the optical
measurement system (NAVCAM, OSIRIS). After detection, knowledge of
the comet ephemeris is drastically improved by processing the on-
board observations. Image processing on the ground derives a coarse
estimation of comet size, shape and rotation. The first landmarks are
identified.
 
The approach manoeuvre sequence reduces the relative velocity in
stages down to 3.1 m/s after 30 days. The manoeuvre strategy is
designed to:
* retain an apparent motion of the comet with respect to the star
background,
* retain the illumination angle (Sun-comet-spacecraft) below 70
degrees,
* avoid the danger of impact with the cometary nucleus in case of
manoeuvre failure.
 
The FAT ends at the Approach Transition Point (ATP), which is located
in the Sun direction at about 1000 comet nucleus radii from the
nucleus. During this phase the spacecraft is in active cruise mode
with the navigation camera and some orbiter payloads switched on.
 
-> Close Approach Trajectory (CAT)
Close approach trajectory operations start at ATP and take 17 days.
The spacecraft distance to the comet is decreased to 40 nucleus radii
and the relative velocity falls below 1 m/s. The final point of this
phase is called the Orbit Insertion Point (OIP) and is the point
where the spacecraft starts orbiting the comet. The injection is
performed by means of a hyperbolic orbit. Lines of sight to landmarks
are processed together with on-ground radiometric measurements in
order to estimate the spacecraft's relative position and velocity,
the comet absolute position, attitude, nucleus angular velocity,
gravitational constant and location of landmarks.
 
-> Transition to Global Mapping (TGM)
The transition to global mapping starts at OIP. A hyperbolic arc is
used down to a distance to the comet of about 10-25 comet radii where
a capture manoeuvre closes the orbit. The plane of motion is defined
by the comet spin axis and the Sun direction. This plane is rotated
slightly in order to avoid solar eclipses and Earth occultations.
 
-> Global Mapping Phase (GMP)
Mission scenarios have the objective of completing a science goal and
require a trajectory and attitude profile which is driven by
experiments selected to have priority in achieving this goal. The
first scenario is the mapping scenario, during which at least 80 % of
the comet surface is observed from a circular orbit with a radius in
the range of 10-25 comet radii and the comet model increases in
accuracy by evaluating the scientific results.
 
-> Close Observation Phase (COP)
In this second scenario detailed observations are made of up to five
potential landing sites for the Rosetta lander from a distance of
less than 1 nucleus radius.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Lander delivery and relay phase
-------------------------------
The priority of this phase is the successful delivery of the lander
to the surface of the comet. After the landing, the Rosetta orbiter
is brought into a trajectory which is optimised such that the orbiter
can act as a relay for the lander-ground communications. Note that
the other experiments are also operating during this phase, regular
science planning is performed. However, the operations of other
experiments cannot interfere with the lander operations.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Escort phase
------------
-> Comet activity: low activity (LOW)
Starting from 3.5 to 3.3 AU the comet develops a measurable coma. At
this point spacecraft resources limit the on-board orbiter
experiments to be fully operational and time-sharing by choosing
priorities determines the operations. Over the interval of 3.3 to 2.6
AU the activity is low and more or less constant, but occurrences of
outburst are possible. The nominal start of the scientific mission is
3.25 AU and spacecraft resources are capable of supporting full
experiments operations. It is a mission preference that the lander is
separated preferably before 3 AU while the comet is still relatively
in-active. Therefore the lander separation and relay has to be
executed as soon as a landing site has been selected. (Note that the
lander team baselines a delivery at 3 AU and not before.)
 
-> Comet activity: moderate increase (MINC)
The overall activity is expected to show a steady and moderate
increase. The completion of the science objectives drive the
selection of the mission scenarios for this phase.
 
-> Comet activity: sharp increase (SINC)
A sudden and steep increase in activity together with a change in
outgassing conditions are expected for this phase from previous
observations. Special orbit requirements, like dust/gas jet
crossings, are possible for mission scenario selection.
 
-> Comet activity: high activity (HIGH)
The production rate of gas and dust is expected to have a steep
increase indicating a distinct change in outgassing conditions. The
thermal conditions of the spacecraft for distances smaller then 1.4
AU may influence the science operations capabilities and time-sharing
of the payload operations may be necessary.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Near perihelion phase
---------------------
This phase is likely to show a steady increase of overall activity.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Extended mission
----------------
Nominally, unless a mission extension is agreed and if the spacecraft
survives in the cometary environment, the mission ends at the
perihelion pass after 11.5 years. If possible, however, the mission
is continued. More risky or more time consuming scenarios may be
executed.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
 
Orbiter Experiments
=====================================================================
 
ALICE
-----
ALICE, an Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer, will characterize the
composition of the nucleus and coma, and the nucleus/coma coupling of
comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This will be accomplished through
the observation of spectral features in the extreme and far
ultraviolet (EUV/FUV) spectral regions from 70 to 205 nm.
 
ALICE will make measurements of noble gas abundances in the coma, the
atomic budget in the coma, and major ion abundances in the tail and
in the region where solar wind particles interact with the ionosphere
of the comet. ALICE will determine the production rates, variability,
and structure of H2O and CO, and CO2 gas surrounding the nucleus and
the far-UV properties of solid grains in the coma.
 
ALICE will also map the cometary nucleus in the FUV, and study Mars
and the Rosetta asteroid flyby targets while en route to Churyumov-
Gerasimenko.

CONSERT
-------
CONSERT (Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radio wave
Transmission) is an experiment that will perform tomography of the
comet nucleus revealing its internal structure. CONSERT operates as a
time domain transponder between the Lander which will be on the comet
surface and the Orbiter will orbit the comet. A radio signal passes
from the orbiting component of the instrument to the component on the
comet surface and is then immediately transmitted back to its source,
the idea being to establish a radio link that passes through the
comet nucleus. The varying propagation delay as the radio waves pass
through different parts of the cometary nucleus will be used to
determine the dielectric properties of the nuclear material. Many
properties of the comet nucleus will be examined as its overall
structural homogeneity, the average size of the sub-structures
(Cometesimals) and the number and thickness of the various layers
beneath the surface.
 
Instrument References: [KOFMANETAL2007]
 
COSIMA
------
The Cometary Secondary Ion Mass Analyser is a secondary ion mass
spectrometer equipped with a dust collector, a primary ion gun, and
an optical microscope for target characterization. Dust from the near
comet environment is collected on a target. The target is then moved
under a microscope where the positions of any dust particles are
determined. The cometary dust particles are then bombarded with pulses
of indium ions from the primary ion gun. The resulting secondary ions
are extracted into the time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
 
Instrument References: [KISSELETAL2007]
 
GIADA
-----
The Grain Impact Analyser and Dust Accumulator will measure the
scalar velocity, size and momentum of dust particles in the coma of
the comet using an optical grain detection system and a mechanical
grain impact sensor. Five microbalances will measure the amount of
dust collected as the spacecraft orbits the comet.
 
Instrument References: [COLANGELIETAL2007]
 
MIDAS
-----
The Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System is intended for the
microtextural and statistical analysis of cometary dust particles.
The instrument is based on the technique of atomic force microscopy.
This technique, under the conditions prevailing at the Rosetta
Orbiter permits textural and other analysis of dust particles to be
performed down to a spatial resolution of 4nm.
 
Instrument References: [RIEDLERETAL2007]
 
MIRO
----
MIRO (Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter) is composed of a
millimetre wave mixer receiver and a submillimetre heterodyne
receiver. The submillimetre wave receiver provides both broad band
continuum and high resolution spectroscopic data, whereas the
millimetre wave receiver provides continuum data only.
 
MIRO will measure the near surface temperature of the comet, allowing
estimation of the thermal and electrical properties of the surface.
In addition, the spectrometer portion of MIRO will allow measurements
of water, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol in the comet coma.

OSIRIS
------
OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System)
is a dual camera imaging system operating in the visible, near
infrared and near ultraviolet wavelength ranges. OSIRIS consists of
two independent camera systems sharing common electronics. The narrow
angle camera is designed to produce high spatial resolution images of
the nucleus of the target comet. The wide angle camera has a wide
field of view and high straylight rejection to image the dust and gas
directly above the surface of the nucleus of the target comet. Each
camera is equipped with filter wheels to allow selection of imaging
wavelengths for various purposes. The spectroscopic and wider band
infrared imaging capabilities originally proposed and incorporated in
the instrument name were descoped during development.
 
Instrument References: [KELLERETAL2006]
 
ROSINA
------
ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis)
consists of two mass spectrometers, since no one technique is able to
achieve the resolution and accuracy required to fulfil the ROSETTA
mission goals over the range of molecular masses under analysis. In
addition, two pressure gauges provide density and velocity data for
the cometary gas.
 
The two mass analysers are:
* A double focusing magnetic mass spectrometer with a mass range of 1
- 100 amu and a mass resolution of 3000 at 1 % peak height, optimised
for very high mass resolution and large dynamic range
* A reflectron type time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a mass
range of 1 -300 amu and a mass resolution better than 500 at 1 % peak
height, optimised for high sensitivity over a very broad mass range

RPC
---
RPC (Rosetta Plasma Consortium) is a set of five sensors sharing a
common electrical and data interface with the Rosetta orbiter. The
RPC sensors are designed to make complementary measurements of the
plasma environment around the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
 
The RPC sensors are:
* ICA: an Ion Composition Analyser, which measures the three-
  dimensional velocity distribution and mass distribution of positive
  ions;
* IES: an Ion and Electron Sensor, which will simultaneously measure
  the flux of electrons and ions in the plasma surrounding the comet;
* LAP: a Langmuir Probe, which will measure the density, temperature
  and flow velocity of the cometary plasma;
* MAG: a Fluxgate Magnetometer, which will measure the magnetic field
  in the region where the solar wind plasma interacts with the comet;
  Instrument References: [GLASSMEIERETAL2007B]
* MIP: a Mutual Impedance Probe, which will derive the electron gas
  density, temperature, and drift velocity in the inner coma of the
  comet.

RSI
---
RSI (Radio Science Investigation) makes use of the communication
system that the Rosetta spacecraft uses to communicate with the
ground stations on Earth. Either one-way or two-way radio links can
be used for the investigations. In the one-way case, a signal
generated by an ultra-stable oscillator on the spacecraft is received
on earth for analysis. In the two way case, a signal transmitted from
the ground station is transmitted back to Earth by the spacecraft. In
either case, the downlink may be performed in either X-band or both X
-band and S-band.
 
RSI will investigate the nondispersive frequency shifts (classical
Doppler) and dispersive frequency shifts (due to the ionised
propagation medium), the signal power and the polarization of the
radio carrier waves. Variations in these parameters will yield
information on the motion of the spacecraft, the perturbing forces
acting on the spacecraft and the propagation medium.
 
Instrument References: [PAETZOLDETAL2007]
 
VIRTIS
------
VIRTIS (Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer) is an
imaging spectrometer that combines three data channels in one
instrument. Two of the data channels are committed to spectral
mapping and are housed in the Mapper optical subsystem. The third
channel is devoted solely to spectroscopy and is housed in the High
resolution optical subsystem.
 
The mapping channel optical system is a Shafer telescope consisting
of five aluminium mirrors mounted on an aluminium optical bench. The
mapping channel uses a silicon charge coupled device (CCD) to detect
wavelengths from 0.25 micron to 1 micron and a mercury cadmium
telluride (HgCdTe) infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) to detect from
0.95 micron to 5 microns.
 
The high resolution channel is an echelle spectrometer. The incident
light is collected by an off-axis parabolic mirror and then
collimated by another off-axis parabola before entering a cross-
dispersion prism. After exiting the prism, the light is diffracted by
a flat reflection grating, which disperses the light in a direction
perpendicular to the prism dispersion. The high-resolution channel
employs a HgCdTe IRFPA to perform detection from 2 to 5 microns.

SREM
----
The Standard Radiation Environment Monitor (SREM) is a monitor-class
instrument intended for space radiation environment characterisation
and radiation housekeeping purposes. SREM will provide continuous
directional, temporal, and spectral data of high-energy electron,
proton, and cosmic ray fluxes encountered along the orbit of the
spacecraft, as well as measurements of the total accumulated
radiation dose absorbed by SREM itself.
 
This instrument is a facility monitor flown on several ESA
spacecrafts. It is not considered as a PI (Principal Investigator)
instrument.

LANDER (PHILAE)
=====================================================================
 
The 100 kg Rosetta Lander, named Philae, will be the first spacecraft
ever to make a soft landing on the surface of a comet nucleus. The
Lander is provided by a European consortium under the leadership of
the German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) and the French Space
Research Center (CNES). Other members of the consortium are ESA and
institutes from Austria, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy and
the UK. A descripion of the Lander can be found in [RO-EST-RS-3020].
 
The box-shaped Lander is carried in piggyback fashion on the side of
the Orbiter until it arrives at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Once
the Orbiter is aligned correctly, the ground station commands the
Lander to self-eject from the main spacecraft and unfold its three
legs, ready for a gentle touch down at the end of the ballistic
descent. On landing, the legs damp out most of the kinetic energy to
reduce the chance of bouncing, and they can rotate, lift or tilt to
return the Lander to an upright position.
 
Immediately after touchdown, a harpoon is fired to anchor the Lander
to the ground and prevent it escaping from the comet's extremely weak
gravity. The minimum mission target for scientific observations is
one week, but surface operations may continue for many months.
 
Science Objectives
------------------
It is the general aim of the scientific experiments carried and
operated by the Rosetta Lander to obtain a first in situ composition
analysis of primitive material from the early solar system, to study
the composition and structure of a cometary nucleus, reflecting
growth processes in the early solar system, to provide ground truth
data for the Rosetta Orbiter experiments and to investigate dynamic
processes leading to changes in cometary activity.
 
The primary objective of the Rosetta Lander mission is the in situ
investigation of the elemental, isotopic, molecular and mineralogic
composition and the morphology of early solar system material as it
is preserved in the cometary nucleus. Measurement of the absorption
and phase shift of electromagnetic waves penetrating the comet
nucleus will help to determine its internal structure. Seismometry
and magnetometry will also be used to investigate the interior of the
comet.
 
The scientific objectives of the Rosetta Lander can be listed
according to their priority as follows:
1. Determination of the composition of cometary surface and
   subsurface matter: bulk elemental abundances, isotopic ratios,
   minerals, ices, carbonaceous compounds, organics, volatiles - also
   in dependence on time and insolation.
2. Investigation of the structure and physical properties of the
   cometary surface: topography, texture, roughness, regolith scales,
   mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal properties,
   temperatures. Characterization of the near surface plasma
   environment.
3. Investigation of the global internal structure.
4. Investigation of the comet/plasma interaction.
 
The in situ measurements performed by the Rosetta Lander instruments
will also provide local ground truth to calibrate Orbiter
instruments.
 
Lander Experiments
------------------
The Rosetta-Lander is equipped with a Sample Drill & Distribution
(SD2) subsystem which is in charge to collect cometary surface
samples at given depth and distribute them to the following
instruments: CIVA-M (microscope (MS) & Infrared Spectrometer (IS)),
the ovens, serving COSAC and PTOLEMY.
 
Comet sample from pre-determinated and/or known (measured) depth are
collected and transported by SD2 to well defined locations:
* MS & IS viewing place
* ovens for high temperature (800 deg C) heating
* ovens for medium temperature (130 deg C) heating.
* ovens with a window, where samples can be investigated by CIVA-M
 
Here a description of all the instruments of the Lander:
 
APXS: Alpha-p-X-ray spectrometer
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The goal of the Rosetta APXS experiment is the determination of the
chemical composition of the landing site and its potential alteration
during the comet's approach to the Sun. The data obtained will be
used to characterize the surface of the comet, to determine the
chemical composition of the dust component, and to compare the dust
with known meteorite types.

CIVA: Panoramic and microscopic imaging system
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Cometary Infrared and Visible Analiser (CIVA) is an integrated
set of imaging instruments, designed to characterize the landing and
sampling site, the 360 deg panorama as seen from the Rosetta Lander,
all samples collected and delivered by the Drill Sample and
Distribution System, and the stratigraphy within the boreholes. It is
constituted by a panoramic stereo camera (CIVA-P), and a microscope
coupled to an IR spectrometer (CIVA-M). CIVA is sharing a common
Imaging Main Electronics (CIVA/ROLIS/IME) with ROLIS. CIVA-P will
characterize the landing site, from the landing legs to the local
horizon. The camera is composed of 6 identical micro-cameras, mounted
of the Lander sides, with their optical axes separated by 60 deg. In
addition, stereoscopic capability is provided by one additional micro-
camera, identical to and co-aligned with one of the panoramic micro-
camera, with its optical axis 10 cm apart.
 
CIVA-M combines in separated boxes, two ultra-compact and
miniaturized channels, one visible microscope CIVA-M/V and one IR
spectrometer CIVA-M/I, to characterize, by non-destructive analyses,
the texture, albedo, mineralogical and molecular composition of each
of the samples collected and distributed by the Drill Sample and
Distribution System.

The COmetary SAmpling and Composition experiment COSAC is one of the
two 'evolved gas analysers' (EGAs) on board the Rosetta-Lander.
Whereas the other EGA, Ptolemy, aims mainly at accurately measuring
isotopic ratios of light elements, the COSAC is specialised on
detection and identification of complex organic molecules. The
instrument can be described as an effort to analyse in situ, mainly
with respect to the composition of the volatile fraction, cometary
matter nearly as well and accurately as could be done in a laboratory
on Earth. Due to the Rosetta Lander rotatability, the instrument can
conduct analyses and investigations at different spots of the landing
site and, aided by the drill, take samples for analysis from a depth
up to at least 0.2 m.

The size of a small shoe box and weighing less than 5 kg, Ptolemy
will use gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GCMS) techniques to
investigate the comet surface & subsurface. The instrument concept is
termed 'MODULUS' which is taken to mean Methods Of Determining and
Understanding Light elements from Unequivocal Stable isotope
compositions. The scientific goal of the PTOLEMY is to understand the
geochemistry of light elements, such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen
and oxygen, by determining their nature, distribution and stable
isotopic compositions.

MUPUS: Measurements of surface and subsurface properties
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Multi-Purpose Sensor Experiment actually consists of four parts:
1. A penetrator, approximately 40 cm long, will be hammered into the
ground about 1m apart from the Lander for measuring during the
penetration process the mechanical strength of the material by means
of a depth sensor and a densitometer. The penetrator is equipped with
a series of temperature sensors and heaters for determining the
temperature as a function of depth and insolation.
2. An accelerometer and a temperature sensor accommodated in the
harpoon(s)
3. A four-channel infrared radiometer measures surface temperatures
in the vicinity of the Lander. Density of the nearsurface (down to
20cm) material will be determined by measuring the absorption of
gamma-rays emitted from a radioactive isotope mounted at the tip of
the penetrator.

sensor experiment. The magnetic field is measured with a fluxgate
magnetometer. An electrostatic analyzer with integrated Faraday cup
measures ions and electrons. The local pressure is measured with
Pirani and Penning sensors. The sensors are situated on a short boom.
The deployment on the surface of a cometary nucleus demanded the
development of a special digital magnetometer of little weight and
small power requirements. For the first time a magnetic sensor will
be operated from within a plasma sensor. A prototype of the
magnetometer, named SPRUTMAG, was flown on space station MIR.

The sampling, drilling and distribution (SD2) subsystem will provide
microscopes and advanced gas analysers with samples collected at
different depths below the surface of the comet. Specifically SD2 can
bore up to 250 mm into the surface of the comet and collect samples
of material at predetermined and/or known depths. It then transports
each sample to a carousel which feeds samples to different instrument
stations: a spectrometer, a volume check plug, ovens for high and
medium temperatures and a cleaning station. SD2 will be accommodated
on the flat ground-plate of the Rosetta, where it will be exposed to
the cometary environment.

GROUND SEGMENT
=====================================================================
 
This section summarizes the roles and responsabilities for the
Rosetta Ground Segment, which are defined in the Rosetta Science
Management Plan [RO-EST-PL-0001] and the Lander Project Plan
[RL-PL-DLR-97002].
 
The primary responsibility for developing the payload operations
strategy for the Rosetta Scientific Mission is the Rosetta Science
Working Team. The Rosetta Science Working Team (SWT) monitors and
advises on all aspects of Rosetta which affect its scientific
performance.
 
Rosetta Ground Segment
-----------------------
The Rosetta ground segment will consist of two major elements: the
Rosetta Mission Operations Centre (RMOC) and the Rosetta Science
Operations Centre
(RSOC).
 
Rosetta Science Operations Center
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Science Operations Center (RSOC) is located at the
European Space Research and Technology Center (ESTEC) in The
Netherlands. The main task is to support the Rosetta Project
Scientist in the planning of the science operations schedule and in
the generation of coordinated operational sequences, the payload
command sequences for all Rosetta instruments and their onward
transmission to the Rosetta Mission Operations Centre (RMOC). In
addition, the RSOC will prepare comet nucleus and comet coma models
in collaboration with the Interdisciplinary Scientists, specialists
from the Principal Investigator teams and the Lander teams.
 
Rosetta Mission Operations Center
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Mission Operations Center (RMOC) is located at the
European Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. The
RMOC is responsible for the Spacecraft operations and all real time
contacts with the spacecraft and payload, the overall mission
planing, flight dynamics and spacecraft and payload data
distribution.
 
Rosetta Lander Ground Segment
------------------------------
The Rosetta Lander Ground Segment (RLGS) is made up of two
operational teams. Due to the discussions when CNES joined the DLR
consortium for developing the Lander, it was decided to divide the
RLGS into 2 centers (see Lander Project Plan [RL-PL-DLR-97002]).
These teams are responsible for the success of the Lander operations,
to ensure that the Lander performs the science with regards to its
status, and to give the data to the PI's and suppliers.

All scientific data obtained during the full mission duration will
remain proprietary of the PI teams and the Lander teams for a maximum
period of one year after they have been received from ESOC. After
this period, the scientific data products from the mission have to be
submitted to RSOC in a reduced and calibrated form such that they can
be used by the scientific community. RSOC will prepare the Rosetta
Scientific Data Archive within one year of the receipt of the
complete data sets from the individual Rosetta science
investigations.

ROSETTA Mission Overview
=====================================================================
 
The ROSETTA mission is an interplanetary mission whose main
objectives are the rendezvous and in-situ measurements of the comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, scheduled for 2014/2015. The spacecraft
carries a Rosetta Lander, named Philae, to the nucleus and deploys it
onto its surface.
 
A brief description of the mission and its objectives can be found in
the Rosetta Science Management Plan [RO-EST-PL-0001] and in papers
[GLASSMEIERETAL2007A]. A detailed description of the
mission analysis can be found in the Consolidated Report on Mission
Analysis [RO-ESC-RP-5500], the ROSETTA User Manual [RO-DSS-MA-1001],
and the flight Operations Plan [RO-ESC-PL-5000].
 
On its long way to the comet nucleus after a Launch by Ariane 5 P1+
in March 2004, the ROSETTA spacecraft orbits the Sun for one year
until it returns to Earth for the first swing-by. The planet Mars is
reached in February 2007, about 3 years after launch. In November
2007 a second Earth swing-by takes place and a third one in November
2009. Two asteroid flybys (2867 Steins and 21 Lutetia) are performed
on the way to the comet. These two asteroids were selected at the
Science Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004 among all the
available candidate asteroids, depending on the scientific interest
and the propellant required for the correction manoeuvre. Around the
aphelion of its orbit, which is 5.3 AU from the Sun, the spacecraft
is in a spinning hibernation mode for about 2.5 years.
 
The comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is reached about 10.5 years after
launch, in May 2014. After a comet mapping phase the Surface Science
Package, carried piggyback on the spacecraft are released for landing
on the comet's surface for in situ measurements. The ROSETTA mission
then makes a detailed study of the comet and its environment until a
Sun distance of 2 AU is reached again after comet perihelion, at the
end of the year 2015.
 
Please note:
------------
The ROSETTA spacecraft was originally designed for a mission to the
comet 46 P/Wirtanen to be launched in January 2003. Due to a delay of
the launch a new comet (67P/Churyumow-Gerasimenko) had been selected
by the Science Working Team on 3rd-4th April 2003 [RO-SWT-2004APR04].
The compliance of the design was checked and where necessary adapted
for this new mission. Therefore in the following all the details and
characteristics for this new mission are used.
 
 
ROSETTA Mission Objectives
=====================================================================
 
The scientific objectives of the ROSETTA mission can be considered
from three main viewpoints:
 
First of all, comets and asteroids are fully-fledged members of our
solar system, which means, that they are objects of intrinsic
interest to planetary scientists. The level of investigations
conducted on these bodies is therefore far below that achieved for
the other objects of the solar system.
The study of the small solar-system bodies arguably represents the
last major gap in the tremendous worldwide effort that has been made
to reveal our planetary neighbours to us.
 
The most important scientific rationale for studying small solar-
system bodies is the key role-play in helping us to understand the
formation of the solar system. Comets and asteroids have a close
genetic relationship with the planetesimals, which formed from the
solar nebula 4.57 billion years ago. Most of our present
understanding of these processes has been obtained by studying
meteorites, which constitute a biased sample of asteroidal material,
and micrometeoroids, which may represent cometary grains processed by
solar radiation and atmospheric entry. There is therefore a strong
scientific case of studying cometary material in situ, as it is
surely more primitive than extraterrestrial samples.
 
A third scientific aspect is the study of the physio-chemical
processes, which are specific to comets and asteroids. In this
respect, asteroids can provide information on impact phenomena,
particularly on very large scale. However, the increase in cometary
activity as these bodies approach the Sun undoubtedly represents one
of the most complex and fascinating processes to be observed in the
solar system.
 
Science Objectives
---------------------
The prime scientific objectives as defined in the Announcement of
Opportunity [RO-EST-AO-0001] by the Rosetta Science Team can be
summarized as:
 
- Global characterisation of the nucleus, determination of dynamic
properties, surface morphology and composition
 
- Chemical, mineralogical and isotropic compositions of volatiles and
refractories in a cometary nucleus
 
- Physical properties and interrelation of volatiles and refractories
in a cometary nucleus
 
- Study of the development of cometary activity and the processes in
the surface layer of the nucleus and in the inner coma (dust-gas
interaction)
 
- Origin of comets, relationship between cometary and interstellar
material.
 
- Implications for the origin of the solar system
 
- Global characterisation of the asteroid, determination of dynamic
properties, surface morphology and composition.
 
 
Mission Profile
=====================================================================
 
The ROSETTA mission profile results from the orbit of the target
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which has a perihelion close to 1.2
AU and an aphelion of about 5.7 AU, resulting in a period of about
6.5 years. A detailed description of the Mission Profile can be found
in the Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis [RO-ESC-RP-5500], in
the Rosetta Mission Calendar [RO-ESC-PL-5026] and in the RSOC Design
Specification [RO-EST-PL-2010].
 
The injection of the spacecraft by a single Ariane 5 Launch with the
so-called 'delayed ignition' of the upper stage, is not directly into
the trajectory to the comet, because of the high spacecraft wet mass.
Therefore the spacecraft has to be accelerated by a sequence of
gravity assist manoeuvres at Mars and the Earth, in order to catch up
with the comet's velocity at perihelion. However, this increases the
mission duration to a total of nearly 12 years.
 
The initially large distance to the comet at the perihelion of its
trajectory is slowly decreasing after the third Earth swing-by. At
the intersection of both orbits, the difference in orbit inclination
and the residual relative velocity are diminished by the comet orbit
matching manoeuvre at around 4.0 AU Sun distance. The range of the
spacecraft-to-Sun distance is between 0.88 and 5.33 AU, defined by
the minimum Sun distance during the first five years of the mission
with the swing-bys at Earth, and the maximum Sun distance close to
the aphelion of the comet's orbit. The evolution of the spacecraft
distance to Earth over the mission time follows the profile of the
Sun distance superimposed by an oscillation with an amplitude of 2 AU
(+1,-1) and a period of about one year due to the Earth's motion
around the Sun. This results in a range from 0 AU (Earth Departure
and Swing-by) to 6.3 AU during the superior solar conjunction close
to the spacecraft's aphelion (see Solar Conjunctions section below).
 
After the second and third Earth swing-by ROSETTA crosses the
asteroid main belt, which gives the opportunity of two asteroid
flybys. The asteroids 2867 Steins and 21 Lutetia, are encountered on
5 September 2008 and 10 July 2010 respectively. These two asteroids
were selected at the Science Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004
among all the available candidate asteroids, depending on the
scientific interests and the propellant required for the correction
manoeuvre.
Between the major mission events, up to the comet rendezvous
manoeuvre, the spacecraft performs long interplanetary cruise phases
(up to 2.5 years) with several solar conjunctions (see Solar
Conjunctions section below) and the power critical aphelion passage
(last cruise phase). In order to reduce the ground segment costs and
the wear and tear of spacecraft equipment during these phases, the
spacecraft is put in 'Hibernation Mode'.
 
Two types of hibernation modes are planned to be used:
 
* 'Deep Space Hibernation Mode' above 4.5 AU: Inertial spin mode with
a spin rate of 4 deg/sec. The spacecraft is almost entirely passive,
except of receivers/ decoders, power supply, heaters and two
Processor Modules with one RTU.
 
* 'Near Sun Hibernation Mode' below 4.5 AU: 3-axes stabilised mode
with the solar arrays Sun-pointing and the +X-axis Earth-pointing.
Attitude control is performed with thrusters and star trackers, based
on ephemerides; occasional solar array adjustments and ground
contacts via the medium gain antenna (MGA).
 
The final approach to the comet into its sphere of influence is
prepared by the rendezvous manoeuvre (RVM-2), that matches the
spacecraft orbit with the comet orbit.
 
A subsequent sequence of approach manoeuvres, supported by optical
navigation, takes the spacecraft closer and closer to the comet.
After determination of the physical model of the comet by Doppler and
optical measurements, the spacecraft is inserted into a global
mapping orbit around the comet.
 
The global mapping starts from orbital heights of 5 to 25 comet
radii, depending on the actual size, shape and mass of the comet.
Close observation of specific landmarks from altitudes down to one
comet radius is planned. At least 80% of the illuminated surface
shall be mapped. The very low velocity of the spacecraft in the comet
orbit (few cm/s) requires a high performance accuracy of the
propulsion system.
 
The delivery of the Lander or Surface Science Package (SSP) is
achieved from an eccentric orbit, which takes the spacecraft to a low
altitude above the selected landing site. The Lander release is fully
automatic according to a predefined schedule, and shall lead to touch
down with minimum vertical and horizontal velocities relative to the
local rotating surface. Upon the landing of the Lander, the
spacecraft provides uplink and downlink data relay between the Lander
and the Earth.
 
After the Lander delivery the ROSETTA spacecraft escorts the comet
until the perihelion passage and outwards again, until a Sun distance
of 2 AU is reached end of the year 2015. The main scientific
objective during this phase is the monitoring of the features of the
active comet.

Payload Checkouts
-----------------
Payload checkouts are scenarios designed to allow Rosetta payload to
make regular health checks, to activate mechanisms and to monitor
trends through calibration tests. They are allocated in the mission
calendar at regular 6-month periods during the first 10 years of the
mission cruise phase. They are split into passive and active payload
checkouts. Passive payload checkouts are entirely non-interactive.
Conditions for the passive checkout are that it will:
a) not require any real time monitoring, b) run entirely off of MTL,
c) not require s/c specific pointing other than to maintain listed
constraints, d) produce minimal science data. Active payload checkout
operations are executed both interactively and non-interactively .
Conditions for the active checkout are that it will: a) limit the
requirement for real time monitoring, b) run mostly from MTL, c) limit
the requirement for s/c specific pointing beyond maintaining listed
constraints, d) produce minimal science data. There is more
flexibility during active checkouts and in addition payloads use
interactive passes to make any necessary memory patches and tests.

Solar Conjunctions/Oppositions
-------------------------------
Other mission phases, which result from the orbit geometry and
interfere with the above operational phases, are the solar
conjunctions. Two types of conjunctions occur throughout the mission:
 
* Solar Oppositions: The Earth is between spacecraft and Sun,
resulting in a degradation of the command link to the spacecraft.
 
* Superior Solar Conjunctions: Sun is between spacecraft and Earth,
resulting in a degradation of the command and telemetry link to/from
the spacecraft.
 
Table below shows the solar conjunction phases throughout the mission
with type, begin and duration of the conjunction and correspondant
mission phase. The phases are defined as the periods, during which
the Sun-SpaceCraft-Earth (SSCE) angle is below 5 degrees.

Mission Phases Description
=====================================================================
 
Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP)
-----------------------------
Rosetta was launched by an Ariane 5/G+ in a dedicated flight (single
launch configuration) from Kourou at 07:17:51 UTC 2 March 2004. After
burnout of the lower composite, the upper stage together with the
spacecraft remained in an eccentric coast arc for nearly 2 hours.
Then the upper stage performed delayed ignition and injected the
Rosetta spacecraft into the required escape hyperbola.
 
After spacecraft separation from the upper stage, Rosetta acquires
its three axes stabilised Sun pointing attitude and deploys the solar
arrays autonomously. Ground operations acquire the down-link in
S-band using the ESA network and control the spacecraft to a fine-
pointing attitude with the HGA pointing towards Earth using X-band
telemetry. Tracking and orbit determination are performed, the
departure trajectory is verified and corrected by the on-board
propulsion system of the spacecraft.
 
The launch locks of the Lander Philae are released at the end of the
first ground station pass. Philae remains firmly attached to the
spacecraft by the cruise latches until its release at the comet.
 
Commissioning phase (1 and 2)
-------------------
Commissioning starts three days after launch following the first
trajectory correction manoeuvre. A Deep Space Manouver (DSM1) of 173
m/s is executed at perihelion. All spacecraft functions needed during
the cruise to the comet, in particular for hibernation, are checked
and the scientific payload is commissioned.
 
Commissioning is done in two parts, as the New Norcia ground station
must be shared with Mars Express and cannot be used by Rosetta from
June to mid-September 2004.

Cruise phase 1
--------------
Almost all the scientific instruments, except ALICE are switched off
while ground contact is practically not available. No payload
operations are done during this phase.
 
Earth swing-by 1
----------------
The actual Earth swing-by takes place on 4-Mar-05. The phase ends one
month after the swing-by and the spacecraft is prepared for the next
cruise phase to Mars.
One passive Payload Checkout is scheduled end of March 2005.
Immediately after this flyby an Asteroid Flyby Mode Simulation is
performed using the Moon as a target. Some limited payload operations
are permitted shortly before during and shortly after this Earth
Flyby. Rosetta payload teams are given the opportunity to conduct
scientific investigation that includes close approach of both the
Earth and the Moon and the AFM simulation. Any activities that do not
require the Earth-Moon system i.e. continued instrument commissioning,
are considered for later in the Mission, such as during the next
active checkout.
 
The instrument objectives are listed below.
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE objectives are:
    - Flat field calibration
    - Extended object scattered light calibration (Moon as the target)
    - Absolute solar calibration
    - Absolute flux and wavelength calibration (wide part of the slit
    to take in the Moon)
    - Door performance test due to anomalies raised during
    commissioning

    - Because of technical issues OSIRIS was not operated during the
    Earth Swing-By itself.
 
 
  VIRTIS
    - Co-alignment M/H
    - Aldebaran target in IR (failed, boresight did not detect the
    target)
    - Absolute calibration using the Moon

Problems:
 
  RPC
    - Loss of LAP science data for 41.5 hours (2005-03-01 19:00 --
    2005-04-03 12:30).

Cruise phase 2 (and Deep Impact)
--------------------------------
After leaving the Earth, the spacecraft makes one revolution around
the Sun, and in the second arc from perihelion to aphelion makes a
swing-by of Mars.
 
There is a solar conjunction for more than one month in April 2006
(see Solar Conjunctions section above). Two passive check-outs with
non-interactive instrument operations for about 5 days are scheduled
during the cruise to Mars. PC1 occurs from 5/09/2005 to 5/10/2005. PC2
takes place from 3/03/2006 to 8/03/2006.
 
The NASA Deep Impact mission encounters comet 9P/Tempel 1 on 4 July
2005, which falls into the Cruise 2 mission phase. At around 06:00
UTC, the mother probe sends a 362 kg impactor into the nucleus with a
relative speed of 10.2 km/s. Rosetta is in a privileged position for
its remote sensing instruments to observe the event (80 million km
distance, 90 degrees angle respect to the sun). Rosetta monitors
Tempel 1 continuously (i.e. 24 hrs per day) over an extended period
from 7 days before the deep impact to 11 days afterwards (27Jun-15Jul
2005). The first 2 days ALICE observe the stars for calibration. From
the 28th June to the 15th July, OSIRIS, ALICE, and MIRO operate
observing comet 9P/Tempel 1 continuously. VIRTIS was on only several
hours around the impact. Maintenance activities were carried out for
COSIMA, ROSINA, ALICE.
 
During the Deep Impact subphase, the instruments have the following
objectives:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Baseline pre-impact spectrum. Comparison with near and long
    term post impact spectra. The comet is detected in all spectra.
    - Strong atomic lines of neutral H and O were detected throughout
    the observation period.
    - Two weak lines of neutral C detected on some dates. No change
    detected by ALICE in comet's UV spectrum as a result of impact
    - except for possible enhancement in C emission.
    - No evidence of Ar, S, N, CO.
    - Water production rates. Results TBC.
    - Dark histograms.
    - Calibration star before the encounter. Spectra of calibration
    star is used for calibration of the Deep Impact spectra and
    instrument sensitivity. The data is also used to look for any
    flux variations due to pointing/jitter (initial results do not
    show any evidence of significant fluctuations in the stellar
    count rate).
    - Memory patch (time synchronisation issue).
 
  MIRO
    - Changes in the coma composition induced by the impact.
    - Upper limit on the water production rate in the pre-impact
    phase of the experiment. Water production rate and albeit
    with low signal-to-noise measured in the post impact phase. The
    water production rate is less than has been anticipated based
    on models.
    - Detection of carbon monoxide: the analysis is not complete but
    so far no CO was detected.
    - Estimate of Doppler velocity.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Accurate photometry of the unresolved nucleus (no atmosphere in
    between) with complete time coverage. The time resolution is
    better than a minute around the impact and can draw conclusion
    about the evolution of the impact cloud during the first hour.
    The long term monitoring allowed determination of the composition
    and evolution of the impact cloud (water production and dust/ice
    ratio)
    - UV coverage that allowed imaging of the OH emission at 308nm
    (estimate of the water production by the impact)
    - Imaging of the coma out to at least 150000km from the nucleus.
    The effect of the impact can be seen in the images for
    appromximately a week (stereo reconstruction of coma,
    impact cloud).
 
  VIRTIS
    - Coma and ejecta composition and temporal evolution. But the
    outburst due to the impact was not energetic enough to reach the
    minimum sensitivity required.
 
Conclusions of the Deep Impact Observations:
 
The science objectives of the Deep Impact Observations scenario are
met. The brightness increase of Tempel 1 produced by the impact is
lower than we had hoped for, and as a result the comet was too weak to
be detected by VIRTIS. For ALICE and MIRO the signal was just above
the sensitivity limit, but nevertheless important measurements could
be achieved. The results of OSIRIS even exceeded the expectations, and
the first scientific publications are widely cited. The data collected
by the experiments on board Rosetta are unique because Tempel 1 was
monitored continuously over an extended period of time (no day-and-
night cycle in contrast to ground-based telescopes) and in the absence
of an absorbing atmosphere.
 
The following operations have been done during the Passive checkout 1:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - Electronic and software
    - Test pattern and stim test
    - Memory check
    - dark exposures
    There is no instrument anomalies. The door performance test showed
    nominal behavior.
 
  CONSERT
    - Consert Orbiter verification
    - Consert Lander verification
    - Consert Orbiter/Lander time synchronisation
 
  COSIMA
    - Self check
    - Target manipulator unit maintenance
    - Ion emitter maintenance
 
  GIADA
    - Run mechanisms - cover operations
    - Health check (all subsystems, electronics, noise and
    contamination monitoring, performances estimation)
 
  MIDAS
    - Exercising of all mechanisms (shutter, approach mechanism,
    linear stage, wheel, scanner)
    The test is successful and MIDAS is fully operable.
 
  MIRO
    - Regular exercise and health check of all commands in all modes
    - Regular dump of EEPROM memory to check for radiation damage.
    All objectives are met. There is no radiation damage of the
    EEPROM.
 
  RPC
    - MAG: instrument calibration. Undisturbed solar wind is measured
    to calibrate the offsets of the MAG instrument in quiet conditions
    (Hedgecock method).
    - LAP: instrument calibration.
    - MIP: Instrument checkout
    - IES: measurement in the undisturbed solar wind for calibration
    of its sensors and cross calibration with LAP.
    The PC operations are completed successfully with no change in
    instrument performance for MAG and IES.
 
  RSI
    Two frequency downlink drven by the USO and a ground station
    that can receive the X and S band signals.
    - Investigate the stability of the USO
    - Verify interaction with the ground
    Investigations of the USO data from PC#0 revealed that the
    behaviour of the USO is obviously not as good as it was during
    the last USO test in October.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Exercise the instrument mechanisms
    - Verify the sanity of the CCD
    - Verify the focus
    No anomaly occurs.
 
 
LANDER
  Test of the Lander Platform overall performance
  Secondary battery monitoring
  Lander extended AFT
  CDMS EEPROM dump
  functional test for
    PTOLEMY
    CONSERT
 
The following operations have been done during the Passive checkout 2:
 
ORBITER
 
  ALICE
    - same health tests as PC1. Tests successful.
 
  CONSERT
    - same as PC1. Tests generally successful (see report)
 
  COSIMA
    - self check of all hardware sub-systems on operational voltage
    levels
    - target manipulator unit checkout
    - maintenance COSISCOPE checkout
    - emitter maintenance
    Tests generally successful.
 
  GIADA
    - Same as PC1 plus monitoring of MBS coating evolution.
    The cover operations went fine. There is no further contamination
    of the microbalances. GDS is not fully tested for light
    conditions. IS seems nominal. All HK values are as expected.
 
  MIDAS
    - same as PC1. Tests are successful.
 
  MIRO
    - Same as PC1. Overall success.
 
  RPC
    - Same as PC1. All performances checked are nominal.
 
  RSI
    - Same as PC1. The USO behaves very good, USO drift satisfactory.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Same as PC1. Generally successful. For solar elongation
    angles < 90 degrees OSIRIS gets substantial scattered light
    through the nominally closed doors. The scattered light observed
    during PC2 was unfortunately enough that parts of the CCD surface
    was saturated. This happened in spite of the large exposure time
    reduction that was made after PC1.
 
  VIRTIS
    - The check done were performed properly.
 
LANDER
  Same as PC1 plus functional tests for
    MUPUS
    CONSERT

Mars swing-by
-------------
The mission phase begins two months before DSM2 of 65 m/s, which is
performed near perihelion. The actual Mars swing-by takes place on
25-Feb-07. The minimum altitude with respect to the Martian surface
is 200 km. The relative approach and departure velocity is 8.8 km/s.
During the swing-by a communications black-out of approximately 14
min is expected due to occultation of the spacecraft by Mars.
Furthermore the spacecraft is expected to be in eclipse for about 24
min. The phase ends one month after DSM3. DSM3 of 129 m/s is scheduled
near the aphelion of this arc in order to obtain the proper arrival
conditions at the Earth. Two passive payload check-outs of about 5
days and an active longer one of 25 days are scheduled during the
phase.
 
PC3 starts on 25th August 2006 and ends 30th August 2006.
The following operations were planed during PC3. GIADA and ROSINA did
not take part in this PC.

    is as good as expected. The stability of the USO is still one
    order of magnitude better than anticipated before launch.
 
  OSIRIS
    - Instrument mechanisms, verify the sanity of the CCD, verify the
    focus of the instrument.
 
  VIRTIS
    - Both VIRTIS M and H are working as expected.
    - PC3 has been used to verify the upload of a new pixel map for
    VIRTIS-H to be used during the forthcoming PC4 (pixel map allows
    to drastically reduce the data volume).

Cruise phase 3
--------------
No check-outs are scheduled during the short cruise to Earth.
 
Earth swing-by 2
----------------
Daily operations start again around two months before Rosetta reaches
Earth with tracking and navigation manoeuvres. The actual Earth swing
-by takes place on 13-Nov-07. The perigee altitude is 13890 km. The
relative approach and departure velocity is 9.3 km/s. The phase ends
one month after the LGA strobing phase. In this phase the spacecraft
gets very close to the sun (min distance 0.91AU). One 15 day payload
checkout and one 5 day payload checkout are also scheduled in this
phase.

Cruise phase 4 (split into 4-1 and 4-2)
--------------
In this phase the spacecraft makes one revolution around the Sun.
. A solar
conjunction takes place in January 2009 (see Solar Conjunctions
section above), together with another two conjunctions of the Earth-
spacecraft- Sun angle (Sun-Earth conjunction as seen from the
spacecraft). In this phase the spacecraft gets very close to the sun
(min distance 0.91AU). This Cruise phase has been splitted in two
parts after the selection of the first Asteroid flyby which falls
in the middle of this phase. Cruise 4-1 is before the flyby phase,
and 4-2 is right after. Two passive check-outs are scheduled, one
during Cruise 4-1 and the second one during Cruise 4-2.
 
During this phase, occured
Passive Checkout 9 [see RO-SGS-RP-0030.pdf]
Active Checkout  8 [see RO-SGS-RP-0019.pdf].
 
Steins flyby
-------------
Asteroid Steins was the first dedicated scientific target of the
Rosetta mission. Closest approach was on 5 September 2008 at 18:38:22
UTC. Rosetta flew at 800 km from asteroid Steins. For the first time a
European spacecraft flew next to an asteroid, performed an optical
navigation campaign, and autonomously tracked the asteroid by means of
its on board camera.
 
The 2867 Steins E-type asteroid had been discovered on 4 November 1969
by N. Chernykh. Its dimensions have been estimated by [KELLERETAL2010]
to 6.67 x 5.81 x 4.47 km3, corresponding to a spherical equivalent
radius of 2.65 km. Its sideral rotation period has been estimated to
6.04681 +/- 0.00002h, its pole direction in ecliptic coordinates to
approximately Lambda = 250 deg and Beta = -89 deg with an error of
about 5 degrees [LAMYETAL2008]. Its albedo has been estimated to 0.3
in the visible and 0.4 in the infrared, both by [KELLERETAL2010] and
[LAMYETAL2008].
 
The two asteroids Rosetta flew by are secondary science targets of the
Rosetta mission, with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko being the
primary science target. Therefore, scientific measurements of Asteroid
(2867) Steins had highest priority during the Steins flyby.
Calibrations was performed during the flyby phase only if a
calibration close in time to the actual scientific measurement was
needed.
 
The flyby geometry necessitated a flip in the spacecraft attitude
before closest approach. As a compromise between the incompatible
requirements to minimize the illumination of the -X and +-Y panels of
the spacecraft (flip as late as possible) and to minimize the impact
on the science observations (flip as early as possible), the
spacecraft flip was performed between 40 and 20 minutes before closest
approach. The flyby of Steins is a very fast flyby in the sense that
the distance between Rosetta and the Asteroid changes by an order of
magnitude within 15 minutes before and after the flyby.
 
The heliocentric and geocentric distances of Rosetta during the Steins
flyby was 2.14 AU and 2.41 AU, respectively. The one way light travel
time were 20 minutes.
 
The estimated accuracy of the determination of the position of Steins
in the plane perpendicular to the flight direction during the naviga-
-tion campaign was +/-2 kms for navigation with OSIRIS and +/-16 kms
for navigation with the NAVCAMs (from navigation slot on Sept. 4). For
the targeted passage through phase angle 0 at a distance of 1280 kms
from Steins, a positional offset of 2 kms would correspond to a
minimum phase angle of 0.1 degree.
 
The following table shows an overview of the Steins Flyby scenario:

  Summary results per instrument during closest approach:
    ALICE: Beginning 7 minutes before CA, ALICE made a 10 minute
    histogram observation of the asteroid. The spectrum extracted
    from this histogram observation is the first of an asteroid
    below 200nm and has an excellent signal to noise ratio. The
    observed count rate from Steins was about a factor of two larger
    than predicted. The spectrum of Steins is similar both to the
    spectrum of the Earth's moon obtained during ESB2, and the solar
    spectrum. During CA, Alice recorded the total count rate of the
    detector at a rate of once per second. This data will be used to
    derive a FUV phase curve for the asteroid; this analysis is
    currently under way. There are two spikes in the observed count
    rate, one slightly before passing through zero phase and the
    other centered at the time Rosetta passed through zero phase. It
    was initially thought that this second spike might represent an
    opposition surge. However, subsequent analysis using the
    reconstructed attitude information revealed that the two spikes
    are actually due to the apparent motion of the multiple star
    Rho Oph as Rosetta was tracking the asteroid: the initial spike
    is caused by the star gazing the wide top part of the Alice slit,
    the second spike is caused by the star grazing the wide bottom
    part of the slit, and the gap between the spikes is caused by the
    star lying outside of field of view of the narrow center segment
    of the slit.
 
    MIRO: the instrument was on during approximately 10 hours around
    CA. The instrument was operated in three modes: a)spectroscopic-
    dual continuum mode, b) dual continuum mode, and c)asteroid mode.
    High signal-to-noise responses to Steins were seen in both
    continuum channels, however the responses were of short duration
    (minutes), because of the s/c pointing. Near closest approach,
    the submillimeter beam boresight was located approximately on the
    limb of Steins, rather than near the center of Steins. As a
    result of the mis-pointing, phase coverage was severely limited.
    No spectral features were visible in the individual spectrum
    data. A preliminary study to search for water by integrating
    multiple spectra was carried out, but no spectral line of water
    was detected. The immediate plans are to compare the (dual
    frequency) continuum data with thermal models of Steins. For this
    purpose, both the reconstructed pointing data, and a (projected
    area) shape model for Steins are needed. Using the IR surface
    temperature maps provided by VIRTIS, the goal is to derive a
    subsurface temperature gradient, and the loss tangent of the
    regolith material. It is planned to continue the effort to detect
    or set an upper limit on the water abundance around Steins. The
    full spectrum will also be examined to search for other molecules.
 
    LANDER/ROMAP: ROMAP worked perfectly and all HK values are in the
    expected range. Magnetic field measurements were disturbed by
    MUPUS supply current. All the measured signatures were spacecraft
    generated. The magnetic field measurement showed that Steins does
    not interact significantly (>nT) with the solar wind. The global
    magnetization of Steins has to be therefore less than 1mAm2/kg.
    For the first time both magnetometers (ROMAP-MAG and RPC-MAG)
    worked in parallel doing a true interference test.
 
    LANDER/SESAME: The flyby at asteroid (2867) Steins and its
    observation on 5 September 2008 required an attitude change that
    moved Philae out of the orbiter shadow for about half an hour.
    This circumstance was used to obtain calibration measurements for
    the new CASSE temperature measuring method. CASSE listenings were
    used to investigate the vibration background caused by the orbiter
    reacion wheels (RW). It was found that part of the backgound
    vibration is not caused by the RW but other orbiter units or
    experiment. In addition, new possible harmonics of the RW have
    been identified.
 
    LANDER/MUPUS: MUPUS was continuously operated for 17h around CA,
    starting 7h before CA. During the heating period, a current of
    about 100 mA was drawn from the +12V line which disturbed the
    ROMAP measurements during the flyby. There were differences in
    temperature measurements between ANC-T and TCU sensors. It seems
    that a loss of sensitivity by about 28% compared to the ground
    calibration occurred in the MUPUS TM sensors (TBC during descent
    to comet).
 
    ROSINA: COPS was switched on to the highest sensitivity with both
    gauges. The COPS pressure is normally transmitted in the
    housekeeping, one value every minute. One hour before to one houre
    after CA COPS transmitted science data with a pressure value every
    2 s. There is clearly a peak at closest approach.
    DFMS was switch on in an outgassing mode. The sensor gave error
    during CA due to the cold temperatude of the LEDA. Nevertheless,
    DFMS produced excellent scientific data. The oxygen peak measured
    by DFMS was much more pronounced during the closest approach than
    during normal background measurements. However, the S/C flip also
    produced a high oxygen peak and it remains to be seen what amount
    of oxygen can be attributed to the S/C water and what to the
    Steins exosphere. This needs modelling with the Rosetta S/C model.
    An interesting feature has been seen during the S/C flip: the COPS
    pressure rises much more rapidly than the DFMS oxygen signal. This
    means that the first gas sublimating from the S/C is probably not
    water but a molecule which does not contain oxygen. This is also
    compatible with the fact that COPS measured a much higher pressure
    peak during the flip than during CA whereas for the oxygen of DFMS
    both peaks have similar amplitudes.
    The table below summarizes the ROSINA switch on/off:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Date   | Time  |
    2/09/08| 06:00 | On: Outgassing mode
    4/09/08| 18:00 | Calib and asteroid mode
    5/09/08| 06:00 | Stand by and OFF
    5/09/08| 15:45 | On
    6/09/08| 05:00 | Stand by
    6/09/08| 18:00 | OFF
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    The general conclusion is that COPS and DFMS delivered good
    scientific data despite the DFMS issue. Outgassing of the s/c is a
    problem and has to be taken into account for all operations near
    the comet.
 
    RPC/ICA: ICA was not turned on in the appropriate mode (human
    error) so no data was taken.
    RPC/IES: IES operation during the flyby was nominal although no
    indication of material from the asteroid was seen. RPC IES was
    able to estimate solar wind velocity.
    RPC/LAP: LAP operations were nominal in the entire period of
    operations. The photoemission level was as small as expected (15
    nA) due to the large heliocentric distance (around 2 AU). The
    results (variations in the time series) are still under
    investigation.
 
    RPC/MAG: RPC MAG was switch on between 2008-09-01T00:10:00 and
    2008-09-10T06:01:00. The spectra of the magnetic field data
    measured by the OB sensor show, as usual, an influence of ROSETTAs
    reaction wheels when in Burstmode. The data of the flyby are
    disturbed by pulsed MUPUS heater currents. The currents generate
    magnetic disturbances in the order of 2nT (100nT at the location
    of the ROMAP sensors). The comparision between IB and OB data
    showed that the measurements are very sensitive to specific
    temperature changes at the single sensors. All flyby data are very
    disturbed. Disturbances occur in various time scales. The origin
    of the disturbance cannot clearly be identified (MUPUS?). Rotation
    of the solar array and movement of the HGA cannot be seen in the
    magnetic field data. Any signature of Steins cannot be seen in the
    magnetic field data.
    RPC/MIP: Very low values of MIP sensor temperatures are observed,
    affecting the electronics and MIP response. Interferences are
    observed in the whole frequency range when the temperature is
    particularly low (around -150 degrees). The apparition of these
    interferences is clearly correlated with the satellite manoeuvres.
    Nominal temperatures and spectra are obtained in favorable
    attitude configuration. LDL mode in Normal rate is affected due to
    the lack of emission in this period (to be
    confirmed/investigated). No plasma signature has been observed
    during the STEINS flyby.
 
    VIRTIS: TBW
 
    RSI: The Earth was tracked by the High-gain antenna for most of
    the time around the Steins flyby. However, it was known beforehand
    that a mass determination of the small asteroid Steins would not
    be possible.
 
    SREM: SREM was on during the Steins flyby in its usual
    accumulation mode, but did not perform any Steins specific
    operations.

    COSIMA: After the instrument power on 20080901, the highlevel task
    to image one of the D8 substrates was started. The TMU started
    from its initial position to grasp the D8 target holder from its
    exposed location in the COSIMA dust funnel. The TMU generated an
    error event during the grasping action and stopped any further
    COSIMA command execution. After the operator reported of the error
    to the COSIMA team, all the remaining operations were cancelled
    and COSIMA was left switched on. On the following day, 20080902,
    the COSIMA instrument was shutdown.
 
The Rosetta first asteroid flyby was a success. The navigation
campaign produced highly accurate predictions of the Steins position,
and during the flyby most instruments worked without serious problems.
Asteroid flyby mode worked well, although with somewhat lower tracking
accuracy than expected.

Earth swing-by 3
----------------
Operations are essentially the same as for the Earth swing-by 2. The
actual Earth swing-by takes place in Nov-09. The perigee altitude is
300 km. The relative approach and departure velocity is 9.9 km/s.
Phase starts 3 months before the swing-by and ends 1 month later. Two
short payload checkouts of about 5 days each are scheduled during
this phase.
 
The phase contains the Active Payload Checkout 10 (PC10). This section
will first describe PC 10 and then the Earth Flyby.
 
  PC10
  ----
  The Active PC10 ran for 18 consecutive days from 18th September 2009
  to 4th October 2009. It represented a target independent opportunity
  to perform interactive operations and to request spacecraft
  pointing. All payloads took part in this scenario, as interactive
  or non-interactive operations. There were approximately 425 hours of
  non-interactive and 68 hours of interactive operations. Four
  instruments required active s/c pointing with 15 targets observed
  (111 hours of dedicated s/c pointing). These were mostly for
  calibration purposes.

EAR3 : RO-SGS-RP-0023.pdf
 
Cruise phase 5
--------------
One Active checkout (12) was scheduled during this cruise phase.
It can be noted that Passive Checkout 11 were cancelled since there
was not enough time to include it between PC10 and PC12. PC 11 is
passive meaning that it is mainly instrument healthcheck operations.
PC 10 and 12 are active and more important to preserve.
 
 
Lutetia Flyby  (17/05/2010 - 03/09/2010)
--------------
The second of the flybys took place on 10 July 2010 to the asteroid
21 Lutetia, discovered on 15 November 1852 by H. Goldschmidt. Its
classification into a specific asteroid type had turned out to be
ambiguous and included the possibilities of a C-type or an M-type
asteroid. This contradiction made it an interesting object for close
inspection.
Closest Approach (CA) occurred at 15:45 UT at a distance of 3168.2km.
The relative fly-by velocity was of 15 km/s. The fly-by strategy
allowed continuous observations of Lutetia before, during and for 30
minutes after CA.
Images obtained by OSIRIS revealed that Lutetia has a complex geology
and one of the highest asteroid densities measured so far,
3.4+/-0.3g/cm3. Its geologically complex surface, ancient surface age
and high density suggest that Lutetia is most likely a primordial
planetesimal.
This is the second of the two asteroids selected at the Science
Working Team meeting on 11th March 2004 among all the available
candidate asteroids, depending on the scientific interests and the
propellant required for the correction manoeuvre.
 
The following operations took place around the Lutetia fly-by:
21 May 2010 - 9 July 2010: Navigation campaign (astrometry) using the
OSIRIS NAC and NAVCAM.
5 July 2010- 14 July 2010: scientific operations targeting the
asteroid.
The Lutetia fly-by was a success. The navigation campaign produced
highly accurate predictions of the position of Lutetia and during
the fly-by most instruments worked without serious problems (except
Rosina, RPC IES and RPC ICA). Asteroid fly-by mode worked excellently.
The objectives summarised below have been addressed by the instrument
measurements:
  - Physical and thermal properties, mineralogy and geomorphology of
    Lutetia from spatially resolved multi-wavelengths remote-sensing
    observations between the extreme UV and the mm-range.
  - Determination of the mass of the asteroid from Doppler
    measurements of the spacecraft trajectory.
  - Global shape parameters from light curves taken days before CA.
  - Search for satellite/dust particles.
  - Search for an asteroid magnetic field.
  - Particle and field measurements.
The following summarises the observations and results per instrument:
ALICE
  - Surface reflectance, albedo, colour, light curve by
    spectrophotometry.
  - Surface composition by UV spectroscopy.
  - Asteroid exosphere search by UV spectroscopy: none detected
  - Alice optics decontamination before shutdown.
  - Standard stellar flux calibration using the Alice narrow center
    boresight
  - Standard stellar flux calibration using the Alice -X wide bottom
    boresight
  - Standard stellar flux calibration using the Alice +X wide top
    boresight
  - Dark exposures
  - Boresight cross-calibration with Osiris
  - Background
COSIMA
  - D8 substrates exposure: operational test, no asteroid dust
    identified.
  - All images were technically as expected.
PHILAE
  - ROMAP: no magnetic field detected at CA +/- 30 min
  - PTOLEMY: exosphere search (Sniff mode) [ANDREWSETAL2011]
  - COSAC: Verify mass spectrometer performance, characterise
    (spacecraft) gas environment, exosphere search.
MIDAS
  - Dust search: Target exposure was as expected and dust collector
    facet scan: as expected.
MIRO
  - Exosphere search by microwave (water).
  - Thermal properties by IR and sub-mm observations.
  - Observation of Lutetia during approach
  - Run asteroid mode sequence at CA
  - Observation of Lutetia during recession, includes slew to measure
    southern regions that are in seasonal night
  - Run asteroid mode sequence on dark sky.
ROSINA [ALTWEGGETAL2012]
DFMS and COPS were switched off before closest approach due to
software issue. However, RTOF provided excellent mass spectra.
The data gained during the Lutetia rehearsal are valuable in
distinguishing between spacecraft outgassing and real exosphere data.
  - DFMS: Outgassing
  - DFMS: Spacecraft background measurement
  - RTOF: Outgassing measurement. Signal was detected at CA. The cause
    ( Asteroid exosphere or spacecraft outgassing) is under
    investigation.
RPC
  - Sensor calibration and magnetospheric physics studies (IES and
    ICA software issues)
  - IES: solar wind proton measurements.
  - LAP: observe the solar wind and look for any signatures that
    may relate to asteroid-solar wind to interaction. Determine
    photoemission at large heliocentric distance. Results gave no
    immediately striking signature of asteroid interaction (could be
    revealed in a full analysis).
  - MAG: Reaction wheel influence and the disturbance of the LAP
    instrument can be seen. Comparison between IB and OB showed that
    the measurements are very sensitive to specific temperature
    changes at the single sensors. The flyby data are disturbed most
    of the time. The magnetic impact of Lutetia is less than 1 nT at
    the fly-by distance of 3120km (maximum magnetic dipole moment
    1x10e12 Am2).
  - MIP: same features than for Steins. No plasma signature is
    observed for the Lutetia fly-by. MIP electronics and response
    are affected by low values of sensor temperatures.
  - ICA: Soon after the switch on before Lutetia encounter, the
    temperature of the sensor quickly rose and the instrument was
    automatically powered off.
 
RSI
  - Mass of Lutetia was accurately determined.
OSIRIS
  - Stellar calibration using Vega Stare and 16 Cyg
  - Lutetia lightcurve at CA-80 hours
  - Lutetia observations at CA: Shape, global properties,
    geomorphology, surface composition obtained [THOMASETAL2012,
    MASSIRONIETAL2012, CREMONESEETAL2012, KUPPERSETAL2012,
    VINCENTETAL2011]
  - Support Alice boresight determination
  - Exosphere search by Filter imaging (OH, Na)
VIRTIS
  - Lutetia spectral light curve determination successful
  - Lutetia mineralogic mapping successful during and after CA
  - Thermal properties by Spectrophotometry
SREM
  - On during flyby in its usual accumulation mode but did not
    perform any Lutetia specific operations.

Rendez-Vous Manouver 1   (04/09/2010 - 13/07/2011)
----------------------
The deep space manoeuvre is carried out when the spacecraft has
reached a distance from the Sun around 4.5 AU on 23-Jan-11. One
passive check-out (13) is scheduled during this phase. One solar
conjunction of 50 days and one solar opposition of 37 days happen
during this phase.(see Solar Conjunctions section above).
--PC 13 (1st-9th Dec 2010 + 14th Dec)
This is the final Cruise Phase Checkout. A number of additional
payload operations were also executed, to close out pending and
essential requirements, and/or to configure instruments for the
upcoming Deep Space Hibernation Phase. Only OSIRIS did not participate
in PC 13. PC13 ran for 9 consecutive days between 1st and 9th December
2010. A RSI passive checkout was also completed on 14th December.
All of the operations planned and executed were successful. Minor
issues were observed by 4 instruments (Consert, Philae, Rosina, RPC).
Alice performed succesfully some instrument checkout.
Cosima did periodical maintenance and check its status.
Giada checked successfully its status.
Midas performed a normal passive check-out and an additional modified
one for Deep Space Hibernation Preparation.
Miro performed a normal and sucessful passive check-out.
Osiris did not participate in the PC13 timeframe. However, on 23-26th
March 2011 - post RVM1 - specific OSIRIS operations were performed in
order to prepare and configure the instrument for the Rosetta Deep
Space Hibernation.
The Lander performed some operations and Consert performed an unit
functional test; both were partially successful.
Rosina did not participate in the nominal PC13 scenario, but conducted
several specific operations immediately following completion of the
nominal PC13 timeline. A spacecraft slew was executed with RTOF
monitoring, to further investigate data observed during Lutetia
fly-by.
RPC PIU, IES, LAP, ICA performed checkout with some errors/anomalies
reported, which were considered as no problem for the instrument.
Virtis performed the checkout successfully.
RSI measurements during PC13 showed some disturbances. The cause is
unknown at the time being.
SREM performed a successful checkout.
 
The PC 13 report is:
RO-SGS-RP-0029_2.pdf
 
 
Cruise phase 6
--------------
The whole period is spent in Deep-Space Hibernation Mode (DSHM).
Maximum distances to Sun and Earth are encountered during this
period, i.e. 5.3 AU (aphelion) and 6.3 AU, respectively. During this
phase, 3 superior solar conjuctions and 2 solar oppositions occur
(see table above).
 
Rendez-Vous Manouver 2
----------------------
Not yet occured.
 
Near comet drift (NCD) phase
----------------------------
The spacecraft reaches the comet on 22-May-14 at a distance of 4.0 AU
from the Sun. A sequence of four rendezvous manoeuvres within 30 days
reduce the relative velocity with respect to the comet from 780 m/s
to 50 m/s. The spacecraft is in active cruise mode. During this phase
Rosetta approaches the comet without observing the comet with the
navigation camera (NAVCAM). The comet orbit is determined by a
dedicated ground-based astrometric observation campaign. The errors
in the estimated position of the comet can still be several tens of
thousand km. The final point of the NCD phase is the Comet
acquisition point (CAP) at 100000 km distance from the comet. The
selection of this position depends on two factors: avoiding cometary
debris (assuming there is any), and achieving good comet illumination
conditions.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Approach phase
--------------
 
-> Far Approach Trajectory (FAT)
Far-approach trajectory operations start at CAP. During this phase
the first images of the comet are obtained with the optical
measurement system (NAVCAM, OSIRIS). After detection, knowledge of
the comet ephemeris is drastically improved by processing the on-
board observations. Image processing on the ground derives a coarse
estimation of comet size, shape and rotation. The first landmarks are
identified.
 
The approach manoeuvre sequence reduces the relative velocity in
stages down to 3.1 m/s after 30 days. The manoeuvre strategy is
designed to:
* retain an apparent motion of the comet with respect to the star
background,
* retain the illumination angle (Sun-comet-spacecraft) below 70
degrees,
* avoid the danger of impact with the cometary nucleus in case of
manoeuvre failure.
 
The FAT ends at the Approach Transition Point (ATP), which is located
in the Sun direction at about 1000 comet nucleus radii from the
nucleus. During this phase the spacecraft is in active cruise mode
with the navigation camera and some orbiter payloads switched on.
 
-> Close Approach Trajectory (CAT)
Close approach trajectory operations start at ATP and take 17 days.
The spacecraft distance to the comet is decreased to 40 nucleus radii
and the relative velocity falls below 1 m/s. The final point of this
phase is called the Orbit Insertion Point (OIP) and is the point
where the spacecraft starts orbiting the comet. The injection is
performed by means of a hyperbolic orbit. Lines of sight to landmarks
are processed together with on-ground radiometric measurements in
order to estimate the spacecraft's relative position and velocity,
the comet absolute position, attitude, nucleus angular velocity,
gravitational constant and location of landmarks.
 
-> Transition to Global Mapping (TGM)
The transition to global mapping starts at OIP. A hyperbolic arc is
used down to a distance to the comet of about 10-25 comet radii where
a capture manoeuvre closes the orbit. The plane of motion is defined
by the comet spin axis and the Sun direction. This plane is rotated
slightly in order to avoid solar eclipses and Earth occultations.
 
-> Global Mapping Phase (GMP)
Mission scenarios have the objective of completing a science goal and
require a trajectory and attitude profile which is driven by
experiments selected to have priority in achieving this goal. The
first scenario is the mapping scenario, during which at least 80 % of
the comet surface is observed from a circular orbit with a radius in
the range of 10-25 comet radii and the comet model increases in
accuracy by evaluating the scientific results.
 
-> Close Observation Phase (COP)
In this second scenario detailed observations are made of up to five
potential landing sites for the Rosetta lander from a distance of
less than 1 nucleus radius.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Lander delivery and relay phase
-------------------------------
The priority of this phase is the successful delivery of the lander
to the surface of the comet. After the landing, the Rosetta orbiter
is brought into a trajectory which is optimised such that the orbiter
can act as a relay for the lander-ground communications. Note that
the other experiments are also operating during this phase, regular
science planning is performed. However, the operations of other
experiments cannot interfere with the lander operations.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Escort phase
------------
-> Comet activity: low activity (LOW)
Starting from 3.5 to 3.3 AU the comet develops a measurable coma. At
this point spacecraft resources limit the on-board orbiter
experiments to be fully operational and time-sharing by choosing
priorities determines the operations. Over the interval of 3.3 to 2.6
AU the activity is low and more or less constant, but occurrences of
outburst are possible. The nominal start of the scientific mission is
3.25 AU and spacecraft resources are capable of supporting full
experiments operations. It is a mission preference that the lander is
separated preferably before 3 AU while the comet is still relatively
in-active. Therefore the lander separation and relay has to be
executed as soon as a landing site has been selected. (Note that the
lander team baselines a delivery at 3 AU and not before.)
 
-> Comet activity: moderate increase (MINC)
The overall activity is expected to show a steady and moderate
increase. The completion of the science objectives drive the
selection of the mission scenarios for this phase.
 
-> Comet activity: sharp increase (SINC)
A sudden and steep increase in activity together with a change in
outgassing conditions are expected for this phase from previous
observations. Special orbit requirements, like dust/gas jet
crossings, are possible for mission scenario selection.
 
-> Comet activity: high activity (HIGH)
The production rate of gas and dust is expected to have a steep
increase indicating a distinct change in outgassing conditions. The
thermal conditions of the spacecraft for distances smaller then 1.4
AU may influence the science operations capabilities and time-sharing
of the payload operations may be necessary.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Near perihelion phase
---------------------
This phase is likely to show a steady increase of overall activity.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
Extended mission
----------------
Nominally, unless a mission extension is agreed and if the spacecraft
survives in the cometary environment, the mission ends at the
perihelion pass after 11.5 years. If possible, however, the mission
is continued. More risky or more time consuming scenarios may be
executed.
 
The phase has not yet occurred. The report will be provided later.
 
 
Orbiter Experiments
=====================================================================
 
ALICE
-----
ALICE, an Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer, will characterize the
composition of the nucleus and coma, and the nucleus/coma coupling of
comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This will be accomplished through
the observation of spectral features in the extreme and far
ultraviolet (EUV/FUV) spectral regions from 70 to 205 nm.
 
ALICE will make measurements of noble gas abundances in the coma, the
atomic budget in the coma, and major ion abundances in the tail and
in the region where solar wind particles interact with the ionosphere
of the comet. ALICE will determine the production rates, variability,
and structure of H2O and CO, and CO2 gas surrounding the nucleus and
the far-UV properties of solid grains in the coma.
 
ALICE will also map the cometary nucleus in the FUV, and study Mars
and the Rosetta asteroid flyby targets while en route to Churyumov-
Gerasimenko.

CONSERT
-------
CONSERT (Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radio wave
Transmission) is an experiment that will perform tomography of the
comet nucleus revealing its internal structure. CONSERT operates as a
time domain transponder between the Lander which will be on the comet
surface and the Orbiter will orbit the comet. A radio signal passes
from the orbiting component of the instrument to the component on the
comet surface and is then immediately transmitted back to its source,
the idea being to establish a radio link that passes through the
comet nucleus. The varying propagation delay as the radio waves pass
through different parts of the cometary nucleus will be used to
determine the dielectric properties of the nuclear material. Many
properties of the comet nucleus will be examined as its overall
structural homogeneity, the average size of the sub-structures
(Cometesimals) and the number and thickness of the various layers
beneath the surface.
 
Instrument References: [KOFMANETAL2007]
 
COSIMA
------
The Cometary Secondary Ion Mass Analyser is a secondary ion mass
spectrometer equipped with a dust collector, a primary ion gun, and
an optical microscope for target characterization. Dust from the near
comet environment is collected on a target. The target is then moved
under a microscope where the positions of any dust particles are
determined. The cometary dust particles are then bombarded with pulses
of indium ions from the primary ion gun. The resulting secondary ions
are extracted into the time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
 
Instrument References: [KISSELETAL2007]
 
GIADA
-----
The Grain Impact Analyser and Dust Accumulator will measure the
scalar velocity, size and momentum of dust particles in the coma of
the comet using an optical grain detection system and a mechanical
grain impact sensor. Five microbalances will measure the amount of
dust collected as the spacecraft orbits the comet.
 
Instrument References: [COLANGELIETAL2007]
 
MIDAS
-----
The Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System is intended for the
microtextural and statistical analysis of cometary dust particles.
The instrument is based on the technique of atomic force microscopy.
This technique, under the conditions prevailing at the Rosetta
Orbiter permits textural and other analysis of dust particles to be
performed down to a spatial resolution of 4nm.
 
Instrument References: [RIEDLERETAL2007]
 
MIRO
----
MIRO (Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter) is composed of a
millimetre wave mixer receiver and a submillimetre heterodyne
receiver. The submillimetre wave receiver provides both broad band
continuum and high resolution spectroscopic data, whereas the
millimetre wave receiver provides continuum data only.
 
MIRO will measure the near surface temperature of the comet, allowing
estimation of the thermal and electrical properties of the surface.
In addition, the spectrometer portion of MIRO will allow measurements
of water, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol in the comet coma.
 
Instrument References: [GULKISETAL2007]
 
OSIRIS
------
OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System)
is a dual camera imaging system operating in the visible, near
infrared and near ultraviolet wavelength ranges. OSIRIS consists of
two independent camera systems sharing common electronics. The narrow
angle camera is designed to produce high spatial resolution images of
the nucleus of the target comet. The wide angle camera has a wide
field of view and high straylight rejection to image the dust and gas
directly above the surface of the nucleus of the target comet. Each
camera is equipped with filter wheels to allow selection of imaging
wavelengths for various purposes. The spectroscopic and wider band
infrared imaging capabilities originally proposed and incorporated in
the instrument name were descoped during development.
 
Instrument References: [KELLERETAL2006]
 
ROSINA
------
ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis)
consists of two mass spectrometers, since no one technique is able to
achieve the resolution and accuracy required to fulfil the ROSETTA
mission goals over the range of molecular masses under analysis. In
addition, two pressure gauges provide density and velocity data for
the cometary gas.
 
The two mass analysers are:
* A double focusing magnetic mass spectrometer with a mass range of 1
- 100 amu and a mass resolution of 3000 at 1 % peak height, optimised
for very high mass resolution and large dynamic range
* A reflectron type time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a mass
range of 1 -300 amu and a mass resolution better than 500 at 1 % peak
height, optimised for high sensitivity over a very broad mass range
 
Instrument References: [BALSIGERETAL2007]
 
RPC
---
RPC (Rosetta Plasma Consortium) is a set of five sensors sharing a
common electrical and data interface with the Rosetta orbiter. The
RPC sensors are designed to make complementary measurements of the
plasma environment around the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
 
The RPC sensors are:
* ICA: an Ion Composition Analyser, which measures the three-
  dimensional velocity distribution and mass distribution of positive
  ions;
* IES: an Ion and Electron Sensor, which will simultaneously measure
  the flux of electrons and ions in the plasma surrounding the comet;
* LAP: a Langmuir Probe, which will measure the density, temperature
  and flow velocity of the cometary plasma;
* MAG: a Fluxgate Magnetometer, which will measure the magnetic field

RSI
---
RSI (Radio Science Investigation) makes use of the communication
system that the Rosetta spacecraft uses to communicate with the
ground stations on Earth. Either one-way or two-way radio links can
be used for the investigations. In the one-way case, a signal
generated by an ultra-stable oscillator on the spacecraft is received
on earth for analysis. In the two way case, a signal transmitted from
the ground station is transmitted back to Earth by the spacecraft. In
either case, the downlink may be performed in either X-band or both X
-band and S-band.
 
RSI will investigate the nondispersive frequency shifts (classical
Doppler) and dispersive frequency shifts (due to the ionised
propagation medium), the signal power and the polarization of the
radio carrier waves. Variations in these parameters will yield
information on the motion of the spacecraft, the perturbing forces
acting on the spacecraft and the propagation medium.

VIRTIS
------
VIRTIS (Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer) is an
imaging spectrometer that combines three data channels in one
instrument. Two of the data channels are committed to spectral
mapping and are housed in the Mapper optical subsystem. The third
channel is devoted solely to spectroscopy and is housed in the High
resolution optical subsystem.
 
The mapping channel optical system is a Shafer telescope consisting
of five aluminium mirrors mounted on an aluminium optical bench. The
mapping channel uses a silicon charge coupled device (CCD) to detect
wavelengths from 0.25 micron to 1 micron and a mercury cadmium
telluride (HgCdTe) infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) to detect from
0.95 micron to 5 microns.
 
The high resolution channel is an echelle spectrometer. The incident
light is collected by an off-axis parabolic mirror and then
collimated by another off-axis parabola before entering a cross-
dispersion prism. After exiting the prism, the light is diffracted by
a flat reflection grating, which disperses the light in a direction
perpendicular to the prism dispersion. The high-resolution channel
employs a HgCdTe IRFPA to perform detection from 2 to 5 microns.

SREM
----
The Standard Radiation Environment Monitor (SREM) is a monitor-class
instrument intended for space radiation environment characterisation
and radiation housekeeping purposes. SREM will provide continuous
directional, temporal, and spectral data of high-energy electron,
proton, and cosmic ray fluxes encountered along the orbit of the
spacecraft, as well as measurements of the total accumulated
radiation dose absorbed by SREM itself.
 
This instrument is a facility monitor flown on several ESA
spacecrafts. It is not considered as a PI (Principal Investigator)
instrument.

LANDER (PHILAE)
=====================================================================
 
The 100 kg Rosetta Lander, named Philae, will be the first spacecraft
ever to make a soft landing on the surface of a comet nucleus. The
Lander is provided by a European consortium under the leadership of
the German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) and the French Space
Research Center (CNES). Other members of the consortium are ESA and
institutes from Austria, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy and
the UK. A descripion of the Lander can be found in [RO-EST-RS-3020].
 
The box-shaped Lander is carried in piggyback fashion on the side of
the Orbiter until it arrives at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Once
the Orbiter is aligned correctly, the ground station commands the
Lander to self-eject from the main spacecraft and unfold its three
legs, ready for a gentle touch down at the end of the ballistic
descent. On landing, the legs damp out most of the kinetic energy to
reduce the chance of bouncing, and they can rotate, lift or tilt to
return the Lander to an upright position.
 
Immediately after touchdown, a harpoon is fired to anchor the Lander
to the ground and prevent it escaping from the comet's extremely weak
gravity. The minimum mission target for scientific observations is
one week, but surface operations may continue for many months.
 
Science Objectives
------------------
It is the general aim of the scientific experiments carried and
operated by the Rosetta Lander to obtain a first in situ composition
analysis of primitive material from the early solar system, to study
the composition and structure of a cometary nucleus, reflecting
growth processes in the early solar system, to provide ground truth
data for the Rosetta Orbiter experiments and to investigate dynamic
processes leading to changes in cometary activity.
 
The primary objective of the Rosetta Lander mission is the in situ
investigation of the elemental, isotopic, molecular and mineralogic
composition and the morphology of early solar system material as it
is preserved in the cometary nucleus. Measurement of the absorption
and phase shift of electromagnetic waves penetrating the comet
nucleus will help to determine its internal structure. Seismometry
and magnetometry will also be used to investigate the interior of the
comet.
 
The scientific objectives of the Rosetta Lander can be listed
according to their priority as follows:
1. Determination of the composition of cometary surface and
   subsurface matter: bulk elemental abundances, isotopic ratios,
   minerals, ices, carbonaceous compounds, organics, volatiles - also
   in dependence on time and insolation.
2. Investigation of the structure and physical properties of the
   cometary surface: topography, texture, roughness, regolith scales,
   mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal properties,
   temperatures. Characterization of the near surface plasma
   environment.
3. Investigation of the global internal structure.
4. Investigation of the comet/plasma interaction.
 
The in situ measurements performed by the Rosetta Lander instruments
will also provide local ground truth to calibrate Orbiter
instruments.
 
Lander Experiments
------------------
The Rosetta-Lander is equipped with a Sample Drill & Distribution
(SD2) subsystem which is in charge to collect cometary surface
samples at given depth and distribute them to the following
instruments: CIVA-M (microscope (MS) & Infrared Spectrometer (IS)),
the ovens, serving COSAC and PTOLEMY.
 
Comet sample from pre-determinated and/or known (measured) depth are
collected and transported by SD2 to well defined locations:
* MS & IS viewing place
* ovens for high temperature (800 deg C) heating
* ovens for medium temperature (130 deg C) heating.
* ovens with a window, where samples can be investigated by CIVA-M
 
Here a description of all the instruments of the Lander:
 
APXS: Alpha-p-X-ray spectrometer
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The goal of the Rosetta APXS experiment is the determination of the
chemical composition of the landing site and its potential alteration
during the comet's approach to the Sun. The data obtained will be
used to characterize the surface of the comet, to determine the
chemical composition of the dust component, and to compare the dust
with known meteorite types.

CIVA: Panoramic and microscopic imaging system
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Cometary Infrared and Visible Analiser (CIVA) is an integrated
set of imaging instruments, designed to characterize the landing and
sampling site, the 360 deg panorama as seen from the Rosetta Lander,
all samples collected and delivered by the Drill Sample and
Distribution System, and the stratigraphy within the boreholes. It is
constituted by a panoramic stereo camera (CIVA-P), and a microscope
coupled to an IR spectrometer (CIVA-M). CIVA is sharing a common
Imaging Main Electronics (CIVA/ROLIS/IME) with ROLIS. CIVA-P will
characterize the landing site, from the landing legs to the local
horizon. The camera is composed of 6 identical micro-cameras, mounted
of the Lander sides, with their optical axes separated by 60 deg. In
addition, stereoscopic capability is provided by one additional micro-
camera, identical to and co-aligned with one of the panoramic micro-
camera, with its optical axis 10 cm apart.
 
CIVA-M combines in separated boxes, two ultra-compact and
miniaturized channels, one visible microscope CIVA-M/V and one IR
spectrometer CIVA-M/I, to characterize, by non-destructive analyses,
the texture, albedo, mineralogical and molecular composition of each
of the samples collected and distributed by the Drill Sample and
Distribution System.

CONSERT: Radio sounding, nucleus tomography
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radio wave Transmission
(CONSERT) is a complex experiment that will perform tomography of the
comet nucleus revealing its internal structure. CONSERT operates as a
time domain transponder between the Lander which will be on the comet
surface and the Orbiter will orbit the comet. A radio signal passes
from the orbiting component of the instrument to the component on the
comet surface and is then immediately transmitted back to its source,
the idea being to establish a radio link that passes through the
comet nucleus. The varying propagation delay as the radio waves pass
through different parts of the cometary nucleus will be used to
determine the dielectric properties of the nuclear material. Many
properties of the comet nucleus will be examined as its overall
structural homogeneity, the average size of the sub-structures
(Cometesimals) and the number and thickness of the various layers
beneath the surface.

COSAC: Evolved gas analyser - elemental and molecular composition
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The COmetary SAmpling and Composition experiment COSAC is one of the
two 'evolved gas analysers' (EGAs) on board the Rosetta-Lander.
Whereas the other EGA, Ptolemy, aims mainly at accurately measuring
isotopic ratios of light elements, the COSAC is specialised on
detection and identification of complex organic molecules. The
instrument can be described as an effort to analyse in situ, mainly
with respect to the composition of the volatile fraction, cometary
matter nearly as well and accurately as could be done in a laboratory
on Earth. Due to the Rosetta Lander rotatability, the instrument can
conduct analyses and investigations at different spots of the landing
site and, aided by the drill, take samples for analysis from a depth
up to at least 0.2 m.
Instrument References: [GOESMANNETAL2007]
 
PTOLEMY: Evolved gas analyser - isotopic composition
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The size of a small shoe box and weighing less than 5 kg, Ptolemy
will use gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GCMS) techniques to
investigate the comet surface & subsurface. The instrument concept is
termed 'MODULUS' which is taken to mean Methods Of Determining and
Understanding Light elements from Unequivocal Stable isotope
compositions. The scientific goal of the PTOLEMY is to understand the
geochemistry of light elements, such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen
and oxygen, by determining their nature, distribution and stable
isotopic compositions.

MUPUS: Measurements of surface and subsurface properties
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Multi-Purpose Sensor Experiment actually consists of four parts:
1. A penetrator, approximately 40 cm long, will be hammered into the
ground about 1m apart from the Lander for measuring during the
penetration process the mechanical strength of the material by means
of a depth sensor and a densitometer. The penetrator is equipped with
a series of temperature sensors and heaters for determining the
temperature as a function of depth and insolation.
2. An accelerometer and a temperature sensor accommodated in the
harpoon(s)
3. A four-channel infrared radiometer measures surface temperatures
in the vicinity of the Lander. Density of the nearsurface (down to
20cm) material will be determined by measuring the absorption of
gamma-rays emitted from a radioactive isotope mounted at the tip of
the penetrator.

ROLIS: Descent & Down-Looking Imaging
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The ROLIS Camera (Rosetta Lander Imaging System) will deliver first
close-ups of the environment of the landing place of comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the descent.
After landing ROLIS will make high-resolved investigations to study
the structure (morphology) and mineralogy of the surface.

ROMAP: Magnetometer and plasma monitor
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Lander Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor ROMAP is a multi-
sensor experiment. The magnetic field is measured with a fluxgate
magnetometer. An electrostatic analyzer with integrated Faraday cup
measures ions and electrons. The local pressure is measured with
Pirani and Penning sensors. The sensors are situated on a short boom.
The deployment on the surface of a cometary nucleus demanded the
development of a special digital magnetometer of little weight and
small power requirements. For the first time a magnetic sensor will
be operated from within a plasma sensor. A prototype of the
magnetometer, named SPRUTMAG, was flown on space station MIR.

SD2: Sampling, Drilling and Distribution Subsystem
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The sampling, drilling and distribution (SD2) subsystem will provide
microscopes and advanced gas analysers with samples collected at
different depths below the surface of the comet. Specifically SD2 can
bore up to 250 mm into the surface of the comet and collect samples
of material at predetermined and/or known depths. It then transports
each sample to a carousel which feeds samples to different instrument
stations: a spectrometer, a volume check plug, ovens for high and
medium temperatures and a cleaning station. SD2 will be accommodated
on the flat ground-plate of the Rosetta, where it will be exposed to
the cometary environment.

GROUND SEGMENT
=====================================================================
 
This section summarizes the roles and responsabilities for the
Rosetta Ground Segment, which are defined in the Rosetta Science
Management Plan [RO-EST-PL-0001] and the Lander Project Plan
[RL-PL-DLR-97002].
 
The primary responsibility for developing the payload operations
strategy for the Rosetta Scientific Mission is the Rosetta Science
Working Team. The Rosetta Science Working Team (SWT) monitors and
advises on all aspects of Rosetta which affect its scientific
performance.
 
Rosetta Ground Segment
-----------------------
The Rosetta ground segment will consist of two major elements: the
Rosetta Mission Operations Centre (RMOC) and the Rosetta Science
Operations Centre
(RSOC).
 
Rosetta Science Operations Center
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Science Operations Center (RSOC) is located at the
European Space Research and Technology Center (ESTEC) in The
Netherlands. The main task is to support the Rosetta Project
Scientist in the planning of the science operations schedule and in
the generation of coordinated operational sequences, the payload
command sequences for all Rosetta instruments and their onward
transmission to the Rosetta Mission Operations Centre (RMOC). In
addition, the RSOC will prepare comet nucleus and comet coma models
in collaboration with the Interdisciplinary Scientists, specialists
from the Principal Investigator teams and the Lander teams.
 
Rosetta Mission Operations Center
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Rosetta Mission Operations Center (RMOC) is located at the
European Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. The
RMOC is responsible for the Spacecraft operations and all real time
contacts with the spacecraft and payload, the overall mission
planing, flight dynamics and spacecraft and payload data
distribution.
 
Rosetta Lander Ground Segment
------------------------------
The Rosetta Lander Ground Segment (RLGS) is made up of two
operational teams. Due to the discussions when CNES joined the DLR
consortium for developing the Lander, it was decided to divide the
RLGS into 2 centers (see Lander Project Plan [RL-PL-DLR-97002]).
These teams are responsible for the success of the Lander operations,
to ensure that the Lander performs the science with regards to its
status, and to give the data to the PI's and suppliers.
 
Lander Control Center
- - - - - - - - - - - -
The Lander Control Center (LCC), located at DLR/MUSC in Koeln
(Germany), in charge of Rosetta Lander operations during the flight
segment definition, design, realization, assembly and tests.
 
Science Operations and Navigation Center
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Science Operations and Navigation Center is under CNES
responsibility, located in Toulouse (France). It is responsible for
the navigation and mission analysis aspects, including separation,
landing and descent strategies and generation of the scientific
sequences.
 
Rosetta Scientific Data Archive
--------------------------------
All scientific data obtained during the full mission duration will
remain proprietary of the PI teams and the Lander teams for a maximum
period of one year after they have been received from ESOC. After
this period, the scientific data products from the mission have to be
submitted to RSOC in a reduced and calibrated form such that they can
be used by the scientific community. RSOC will prepare the Rosetta
Scientific Data Archive within one year of the receipt of the
complete data sets from the individual Rosetta science
investigations.

    Orbiter (LRO) on June 18, 2009 5:32 Eastern Time.  After
    trans-lunar injection, LRO separated and performed its mission.
    The LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft (SSC) remained attached to the
    spent Atlas upper stage, called the Centaur.  Over 112 days, the
    Shepherding Spacecraft adjusted the Centaur's course to bring it
    to an impact within the Cabeus Crater near the South Pole of the
    moon.
 
    LCROSS used the Centaur as a 2300 kg kinetic impactor with more
    than 200 times the energy of the Lunar Prospector (LP) impact to
    excavate more than 250 metric tons of lunar regolith.  The
    resulting ejecta cloud was observed from a number of
    Lunar-orbital and Earth-based assets, and the LCROSS spacecraft.
    After releasing the Centaur, the SSC flew toward the impact
    plume, sending real-time data to characterize the morphology,
    evolution and composition of the plume with a suite of cameras
    and spectrometers.  The SSC then became a 700kg impactor itself,
    providing a second opportunity to study the nature of the Lunar
    Regolith.
 
    Mission Phases
    ==============
 
    LCROSS and LRO launched on June 18, 2009 at 21:32 UTC aboard an
    Atlas V launch vehicle in the 401 configuration (4-meter
    fairing, no solid rocket boosters, single-engine Centaur).
    After achieving low-Earth orbit, the Centaur performed a 23
    minute coast, and then re-ignited to perform the trans-lunar
    injection (TLI) burn for both LCROSS and LRO.
 
    Three minutes after TLI, the Centaur separated from LRO and then
    maneuvered to increase separation to avoid contaminating LRO.
    To minimize the residual propellant species aboard the Centaur
    at lunar impact (potential contaminants of water measurements),
    the Centaur next performed a sequence of propellant depletion
    maneuvers with both cryogenic and hydrazine-based reaction
    control systems.  During these depetion maneuvers, the Centaur
    powered the SSC up and pointed its solar array at the sun.
    After the maneuvers were finished, the Centaur ceded attitude
    control to the SSC and shut down.
 
    ------
    Transfer Phase [6/18/2009 - 6/23/2009]
 
    The transfer phase covered the period from TLI to lunar
    swingby.
 
    This phase contained the QUICKLOOK and STARFIELD data collection
    periods.  Both periods were used to confirm instrument function
    and pointing prior to the lunar swingby.
 
    ------
    Lunar Swingby [6/23/2009]
 
    The lunar swingby was a gravity assist maneuver that placed
    LCROSS in a steeply-inclined, nearly circular orbit around Earth
    at approximately lunar distance.  Called a Lunar Gravity Assist
    Lunar Return Orbit (LGALRO), this trajectory returned LCROSS to
    the moon again after three orbits.
 
    Just after closest approach to the moon, the instruments were
    pointed at the surface and turned on to gather calibration data.
    The instruments were swept across the surface, pausing three
    times at targets on the surface with distinctive spectral
    characteristics.  Finally, the instruments were swept back and
    forth across the limb.  This limb-crossing data was used to
    confirm instrument pointing to within 0.1 degree.
 
    ------
    Cruise Phase
 
    Cruise phase activities included trajectory correction
    maneuvers and additional periods of payload data collection
    observing the Earth and Moon.
 
    Several 'Cold Side Bake' activities were also performed to
    reduce ice in the Centaur insulation that remained since launch.
    During these maneuvers, the SSC and Centaur were turned to place
    cold side of the spacecraft, which was normally in darkness, in
    sunlight.  Sublimating ice embedded in the insulation generated
    enough thrust to be detectible in doppler measurements.  If left
    in place, this ice could potentially have contaminated
    observations of the Centaur's impact.
 
    On the second half of the second Earth orbit, LCROSS experienced
    a major propellant loss stemming from a short-lived Inertial
    Reference Unit (IRU) glitch.  This was discovered immediately
    before the third Cold Side Bake event.  With the mission in
    jeopardy, LCROSS declared an emergency and transitioned to
    maximum DSN coverage to enable full-time monitoring.  Over the
    following two weeks, the flight team developed strategies to
    prevent another glitch and to minimize propellant usage during
    planned maneuvers.  With operational and software protections in
    place, the LCROSS project returned to a nominal operational
    posture on Day 78, albeit with a significantly smaller
    propellant margin.
 
    The deadline for final selection of the Centaur target crater
    was 30 days prior to impact.  This late date allowed the Team to
    use early data from LRO to improve the targeting decision.
    During the final two weeks of cruise, the Science Team twice
    refined the target location within the crater.
 
    ------
    Separation
 
    Centaur separation was performed successfully 9 hours 40 minutes
    prior to Centaur impact and, with the substantial change of mass
    properties, was accompanied by a transition to a completely new
    set of attitude control modes tuned for post-separation
    conditions.  One minute following separation, the SSC flipped
    180 degrees to point the payload at the receding Centaur.  These
    observations are contained in the SEPARATION data collection
    period.  Forty minutes after separation, the SSC performed the
    Braking Burn, a delta-v maneuver used to produce a 600 km
    separation between the Centaur and the SSC at the moment of
    Centaur impact.
 
    ------
    Impact
 
    Approximately one hour prior to centaur impact, the spacecraft
    was turned to point the instruments at the predicted impact
    location.  Fifty minutes of calibration data are contained in the
    PREIMPACT data collection.  Five minutes of data are contained in
    the IMPACT data collection, starting one minute prior to Centaur
    impact.
 
    The Centaur impacted the moon at 11:31:19.51 UTC on 10/9/2009 at
    -84.68 deg latitude, -48.69 deg longitude, Mean Earth frame.
 
    The SSC impacted the surface at 11:35:34 UTC.
 
    Earth-based Observations
    ========================
 
    The LCROSS project provided funding for four investigators to record
    Earth-based observations of the LCROSS impact using various observatory
    facilities, and to archive their data in the PDS. Many other Earth-based
    facilities also observed the impact. The four LCROSS-sponsored observers
    were:
 
    (1) Dr. Marc Buie, Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO, using the
    PHOTDOC and PHOTGJON cameras on the Magdalena Ridge Observatory 2.4-m
    telescope, Socorro, NM
 
    (2) Dr. Nancy Chanover, New Mexico State University, using the Agile
    camera on the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-meter telescope at
    the Apache Point Observatory, Sunspot, NM
 
    (3) Dr. Faith Vilas, University of Arizona, using the CCD47 and CLIO
    cameras at the MMT Observatory, Tucson, AZ
 
    (4) Dr. Eliot Young, Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO, using
    three facilities: the Gemini North telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory
    on the island of Hawaii; the SPEX spectrograph and imager on the
    3.0-meter Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) at the Mauna Kea Observatory;
    and the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSPEC) on the 10-meter Keck II
    telescope, Keck Observatory, Kamuela, Hawaii.

<field name="description"><![CDATA[LCROSS launched as a secondary payload with Lunar Reconnaissance
    Orbiter (LRO) on June 18, 2009 5:32 Eastern Time.  After
    trans-lunar injection, LRO separated and performed its mission.
    The LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft (SSC) remained attached to the
    spent Atlas upper stage, called the Centaur.  Over 112 days, the
    Shepherding Spacecraft adjusted the Centaur's course to bring it
    to an impact within the Cabeus Crater near the South Pole of the
    moon.
 
    LCROSS used the Centaur as a 2300 kg kinetic impactor with more
    than 200 times the energy of the Lunar Prospector (LP) impact to
    excavate more than 250 metric tons of lunar regolith.  The
    resulting ejecta cloud was observed from a number of
    Lunar-orbital and Earth-based assets, and the LCROSS spacecraft.
    After releasing the Centaur, the SSC flew toward the impact
    plume, sending real-time data to characterize the morphology,
    evolution and composition of the plume with a suite of cameras
    and spectrometers.  The SSC then became a 700kg impactor itself,
    providing a second opportunity to study the nature of the Lunar
    Regolith.
 
    Mission Phases
    ==============
 
    LCROSS and LRO launched on June 18, 2009 at 21:32 UTC aboard an
    Atlas V launch vehicle in the 401 configuration (4-meter
    fairing, no solid rocket boosters, single-engine Centaur).
    After achieving low-Earth orbit, the Centaur performed a 23
    minute coast, and then re-ignited to perform the trans-lunar
    injection (TLI) burn for both LCROSS and LRO.
 
    Three minutes after TLI, the Centaur separated from LRO and then
    maneuvered to increase separation to avoid contaminating LRO.
    To minimize the residual propellant species aboard the Centaur
    at lunar impact (potential contaminants of water measurements),
    the Centaur next performed a sequence of propellant depletion
    maneuvers with both cryogenic and hydrazine-based reaction
    control systems.  During these depetion maneuvers, the Centaur
    powered the SSC up and pointed its solar array at the sun.
    After the maneuvers were finished, the Centaur ceded attitude
    control to the SSC and shut down.
 
    ------
    Transfer Phase [6/18/2009 - 6/23/2009]
 
    The transfer phase covered the period from TLI to lunar
    swingby.
 
    This phase contained the QUICKLOOK and STARFIELD data collection
    periods.  Both periods were used to confirm instrument function
    and pointing prior to the lunar swingby.
 
    ------
    Lunar Swingby [6/23/2009]
 
    The lunar swingby was a gravity assist maneuver that placed
    LCROSS in a steeply-inclined, nearly circular orbit around Earth
    at approximately lunar distance.  Called a Lunar Gravity Assist
    Lunar Return Orbit (LGALRO), this trajectory returned LCROSS to
    the moon again after three orbits.
 
    Just after closest approach to the moon, the instruments were
    pointed at the surface and turned on to gather calibration data.
    The instruments were swept across the surface, pausing three
    times at targets on the surface with distinctive spectral
    characteristics.  Finally, the instruments were swept back and
    forth across the limb.  This limb-crossing data was used to
    confirm instrument pointing to within 0.1 degree.
 
    ------
    Cruise Phase
 
    Cruise phase activities included trajectory correction
    maneuvers and additional periods of payload data collection
    observing the Earth and Moon.
 
    Several 'Cold Side Bake' activities were also performed to
    reduce ice in the Centaur insulation that remained since launch.
    During these maneuvers, the SSC and Centaur were turned to place
    cold side of the spacecraft, which was normally in darkness, in
    sunlight.  Sublimating ice embedded in the insulation generated
    enough thrust to be detectible in doppler measurements.  If left
    in place, this ice could potentially have contaminated
    observations of the Centaur's impact.
 
    On the second half of the second Earth orbit, LCROSS experienced
    a major propellant loss stemming from a short-lived Inertial
    Reference Unit (IRU) glitch.  This was discovered immediately
    before the third Cold Side Bake event.  With the mission in
    jeopardy, LCROSS declared an emergency and transitioned to
    maximum DSN coverage to enable full-time monitoring.  Over the
    following two weeks, the flight team developed strategies to
    prevent another glitch and to minimize propellant usage during
    planned maneuvers.  With operational and software protections in
    place, the LCROSS project returned to a nominal operational
    posture on Day 78, albeit with a significantly smaller
    propellant margin.
 
    The deadline for final selection of the Centaur target crater
    was 30 days prior to impact.  This late date allowed the Team to
    use early data from LRO to improve the targeting decision.
    During the final two weeks of cruise, the Science Team twice
    refined the target location within the crater.
 
    ------
    Separation
 
    Centaur separation was performed successfully 9 hours 40 minutes
    prior to Centaur impact and, with the substantial change of mass
    properties, was accompanied by a transition to a completely new
    set of attitude control modes tuned for post-separation
    conditions.  One minute following separation, the SSC flipped
    180 degrees to point the payload at the receding Centaur.  These
    observations are contained in the SEPARATION data collection
    period.  Forty minutes after separation, the SSC performed the
    Braking Burn, a delta-v maneuver used to produce a 600 km
    separation between the Centaur and the SSC at the moment of
    Centaur impact.
 
    ------
    Impact
 
    Approximately one hour prior to centaur impact, the spacecraft
    was turned to point the instruments at the predicted impact
    location.  Fifty minutes of calibration data are contained in the
    PREIMPACT data collection.  Five minutes of data are contained in
    the IMPACT data collection, starting one minute prior to Centaur
    impact.
 
    The Centaur impacted the moon at 11:31:19.51 UTC on 10/9/2009 at
    -84.68 deg latitude, -48.69 deg longitude, Mean Earth frame.
 
    The SSC impacted the surface at 11:35:34 UTC.
 
    Earth-based Observations
    ========================
 
    The LCROSS project provided funding for four investigators to record
    Earth-based observations of the LCROSS impact using various observatory
    facilities, and to archive their data in the PDS. Many other Earth-based
    facilities also observed the impact. The four LCROSS-sponsored observers
    were:
 
    (1) Dr. Marc Buie, Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO, using the
    PHOTDOC and PHOTGJON cameras on the Magdalena Ridge Observatory 2.4-m
    telescope, Socorro, NM
 
    (2) Dr. Nancy Chanover, New Mexico State University, using the Agile
    camera on the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-meter telescope at
    the Apache Point Observatory, Sunspot, NM
 
    (3) Dr. Faith Vilas, University of Arizona, using the CCD47 and CLIO
    cameras at the MMT Observatory, Tucson, AZ
 
    (4) Dr. Eliot Young, Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO, using
    three facilities: the Gemini North telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory
    on the island of Hawaii; the SPEX spectrograph and imager on the
    3.0-meter Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) at the Mauna Kea Observatory;
    and the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSPEC) on the 10-meter Keck II
    telescope, Keck Observatory, Kamuela, Hawaii.

  ================
    Apollo 16 was launched on 16 April 1972 UT 17:54:00 on a Saturn V
    rocket from Kennedy Space Center.  Lunar orbit insertion took place
    on 19 April 1972 UT 20:22:28.  The Lunar Module (LM) landed on the
    Moon on 21 April 1972 UT 02:23:35, in the Descartes highland region
    at 8.972 S, 15.498 E, just north of the Dolland crater, while the
    Command/Service Module (CSM) remained in lunar orbit.  The lunar
    ascent module launched from the Moon on 24 April UT 01:25:48.  The
    command module was returned to Earth on 27 April 1972 UT 19:45:05.
 
    The astronauts on Apollo 16 were commander John Young, command
    module pilot Thomas Mattingly, and lunar module pilot Charles Duke.
 
    Three excursions on the first Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) lasted a
    total of 20 hours and 14 minutes and traversed 27 km.  The lunar
    surface stay-time was 71 hours.  During the stay, the Apollo Lunar
    Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP) was placed and activated, and
    94.7 kg of rock and soil samples were collected.  The duration of
    the lunar orbit was 126 hours for a total of 64 orbits.  The small
    sub-satellite was spring-launched at 21:56:09 UT on April 24 into
    an elliptical orbit with a lifetime of one month, rather than the
    planned one-year orbit.
 
 
  Surface Operations
  ==================
    The LM separated from the CSM at 18:08:00 UT on 20 April 1972 and
    landed at 02:23:35 UT on 21 April (9:23:35 p.m. EST, 20 April) in
    the Descartes highland region just north of the crater Dolland at
    8.9730 South latitude, 15.5002 East longitude (IAU Mean Earth Polar
    Axis coordinate system).  Young and Duke made three moonwalk
    extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) totaling 20 hours, 14 minutes.
    During this time they covered 27 km and collected 94.7 kg of rock
    and soil samples, stopping at 11 sites.  The LRV was used during
    EVAs to extend the range of surface lunar exploration.  The first
    EVA was on 21 April from 16:47:38 UT to 23:58:40 UT, during which
    the astronauts set up the ALSEP and other instruments, deployed the
    LRV, and explored the area around the LM and surrounding craters in
    a 4.2-km traverse, stopping at Flag Crater and Spook Crater.
    During the second EVA on 22 April from 16:33:35 UT to 23:56:44 UT
    the astronauts explored a ridge and mountain slope during a 11.1-km
    traverse and visited the Cinco Crater area, halfway up the slope of
    Stone Mountain, and the base of Stone Mountain.  On the third EVA,
    of 11.4 km, on 23 April from 15:25:28 UT to 21:05:31 UT they
    travelled to the southeast rim of North Ray Crater, House Rock, and
    the base of Smoky Mountain.  During all these EVAs the astronauts
    collected samples and took photographs and performed other tasks at
    some sites.  The LM lifted off from the Moon on 24 April at
    01:25:48 UT after 71 hours, 2 minutes on the lunar surface.
 
 
  Surface Experiments
  ===================
    The Apollo 16 astronauts performed and deployed many experiments on
    the lunar surface along with the geologic studies, sample return,
    and surface photography:
 
      - The Solar Wind Composition experiment collected samples of
        solar wind on a large piece of foil which was returned to
        Earth;
 
      - The Cosmic-Ray Detector recorded heavy (high energy) cosmic
        rays from solar, stellar, and galactic sources on detector
        plates which were returned to Earth;
 
      - The Portable Surface Magnetometer studied the strength local
        magnetic sources in the traverse areas.  It was run by an
        astronaut with the results radioed back to Earth;
 
      - The Soil Mechanics Investigations studied the physical
        properties of the lunar regolith using observations recorded by
        video and audio and a surface penetrometer which recorded data
        on a drum which was returned to Earth;
 
      - The Far-Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrometer recorded ultraviolet
        astronomical observations which were returned to Earth ion film.
 
    Other experiments were part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments
    Package (ALSEP) which was emplaced at the landing site by the
    astronauts.  The instruments, connected by cables to a central
    station which controlled power and communications, ran
    autonomously.  Data collected was converted to a telemetry format
    and transmitted to Earth.  Many of these experiments returned data
    until September 1977, when the ALSEP network was turned off due to
    budgetary constraints.
 
    The Apollo 16 ALSEP instruments consisted of:
 
      - A Passive Seismometer, designed to measure seismic activity and
        physical properties of the lunar crust and interior;
 
      - An Active Seismic Experiment to study the physical properties
        of lunar surface and subsurface materials and the structure of
        the local near-surface layers;
 
      - A Lunar Surface Magnetometer (LSM), designed to measure the
        magnetic field at the lunar surface;
 
      - A Heat Flow Experiment, designed to measure the rate of heat
        loss from the lunar interior and the thermal properties of
        lunar material;
 
      The central station, located at 8.9754 S latitude, 15.4981 E
      longitude, was turned on at 19:38 UT on 21 April 1972 and shut
      down along with the other ALSEP stations on 30 September 1977.
 
 
  Orbital Science Experiments
  ===========================
    Investigations were also carried out from lunar orbit in the Apollo
    16 Command and Service Module.  Hand-held photography was performed
    from the command module, and a suite of instruments operated from
    the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) in the Service Module,
    comprising:
 
      - Metric and Panoramic cameras to take photographs of the lunar
        surface from orbit;
 
      - A Laser Altimeter using reflected laser pulses to profile the
        topography of lunar surface;
 
      - A Gamma-ray Spectrometer Experiment to measure gamma ray
        emissions from the lunar surface to determine composition;
 
      - An X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer Experiment to measure
        secondary X-ray emissions from the lunar surface to determine
        composition;
 
      - An Alpha Particle Spectrometer Experiment to measure radon gas
        emissions from the lunar surface;
 
      - An S-Band Transponder Experiment designed to carefully track
        the CSM orbit and measure the lunar gravity field;
 
      - An Orbital Mass Spectrometer Experiment to study the tenuous
        lunar atmosphere and search for active lunar volcanism;
 
      - A Bistatic Radar Experiment used measurements of S-Band and VHF
        reflections to probe electromagnetic and structural properties
        of the lunar surface;
 
      - A Subsatellite released from the CSM into lunar orbit with
        instruments to measure the Moon's gravity field, magnetic
        field, and distribution of charged particles.
 
    Additional experiments were also performed in lunar orbit and
    during the cruise between Earth and the Moon:
 
      - The Ultraviolet Photography Experiment took images of Earth
        and the Moon in UV;
 
      - The Gegenschein Photography Experiment took images of the
        reflections from dust particles at the Moulton point;
 
      - The Window Meteoroid experiment studied micrometeoroid impacts
        on the Apollo 16 Command Module heat shield windows to obtain
        information about the mass flux of micro-meteorites;
 
      - The Skylab-Apollo Contamination Experiment took images of
        scattered visible lightproduced by any residual cloud around
        the spacecraft and studied particle dynamics during liquid
        dumps;
 
      - The Biostack experiment studied the biological effects of
        galactic cosmic radiation;
 
      - The Microbial Ecology Evaluation Device studied the response of
        microbes ot the space environment;
 
      - The Light Flashes Experiment studied the subjective
        observations of faint light flashes seen by nearly all Apollo
        astronauts while in space.]]></field>

      longitude, was turned on at 19:38 UT on 21 April 1972 and shut
      down along with the other ALSEP stations on 30 September 1977.
 
 
  Orbital Science Experiments
  ===========================
    Investigations were also carried out from lunar orbit in the Apollo
    16 Command and Service Module.  Hand-held photography was performed
    from the command module, and a suite of instruments operated from
    the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) in the Service Module,
    comprising:
 
      - Metric and Panoramic cameras to take photographs of the lunar
        surface from orbit;
 
      - A Laser Altimeter using reflected laser pulses to profile the
        topography of lunar surface;
 
      - A Gamma-ray Spectrometer Experiment to measure gamma ray
        emissions from the lunar surface to determine composition;
 
      - An X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer Experiment to measure
        secondary X-ray emissions from the lunar surface to determine
        composition;
 
      - An Alpha Particle Spectrometer Experiment to measure radon gas
        emissions from the lunar surface;
 
      - An S-Band Transponder Experiment designed to carefully track
        the CSM orbit and measure the lunar gravity field;
 
      - An Orbital Mass Spectrometer Experiment to study the tenuous
        lunar atmosphere and search for active lunar volcanism;
 
      - A Bistatic Radar Experiment used measurements of S-Band and VHF
        reflections to probe electromagnetic and structural properties
        of the lunar surface;
 
      - A Subsatellite released from the CSM into lunar orbit with
        instruments to measure the Moon's gravity field, magnetic
        field, and distribution of charged particles.
 
    Additional experiments were also performed in lunar orbit and
    during the cruise between Earth and the Moon:
 
      - The Ultraviolet Photography Experiment took images of Earth
        and the Moon in UV;
 
      - The Gegenschein Photography Experiment took images of the
        reflections from dust particles at the Moulton point;
 
      - The Window Meteoroid experiment studied micrometeoroid impacts
        on the Apollo 16 Command Module heat shield windows to obtain
        information about the mass flux of micro-meteorites;
 
      - The Skylab-Apollo Contamination Experiment took images of
        scattered visible lightproduced by any residual cloud around
        the spacecraft and studied particle dynamics during liquid
        dumps;
 
      - The Biostack experiment studied the biological effects of
        galactic cosmic radiation;
 
      - The Microbial Ecology Evaluation Device studied the response of
        microbes ot the space environment;
 
      - The Light Flashes Experiment studied the subjective
        observations of faint light flashes seen by nearly all Apollo
        astronauts while in space.]]></field>

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
    ================
      The effective launch of ICE took place on 22
      December 1983.  As the spacecraft distance from
      Earth increased, tracking and data acquisition
      involved the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  The
      necessity for this involvement is apparent if one
      considers that the ISEE-3 radio system was designed
      to transmit from the halo orbit at a geocentric
      distance of 0.01 AU, whereas the distance to the
      spacecraft at cometary encounter will be 0.47 AU.
      A major effort required for the ICE mission was the
      outfitting of antennas in the DSN to operate at the
      ICE frequencies.  Current plans are to utilize the
      64 m DSN (Goldstone, Madrid, Canberra) and the 300
      m dish at Arecibo as the prime station.  The
      anticipated data rate at encounter will be 1024
      bit/s, although 512 bit/s may be used at other
      times.  The acceptable performance is based on a
      bit error rate of 10**-4.  There will be additional
      coverage by the 64 m station at Usuda, Japan.
      Operations outside the month centered on the
      encounter date of 11 September 1985 are basically
      cruise-science measurements, which will be
      discussed in the next section.  The ICE spacecraft
      will be approaching the aim point on the main
      plasma tail axis 10000 km from the nucleus.  Some
      idea of the spatial scales associated with key
      instruments and their sampling times is given below
      for the expected data rate of 1024 bit/s.

      For the sampling period indicated, the 'spatial
      resolution' is the distance travelled at the
      relative encounter speed of 20.7 km/s.  These
      dimensions should be compared with the estimated
      distance between bow-shock crossings of about 175
      000 km and a measured main tail diameter of 5000
      km.  Expressed in terms of time, we expect the
      spacecraft to be inside the bow shock for about 2 h
      20 min and in the main plasma tail for about 4 min.
      The magnetometer will produce many measurements
      during the encounter period and we use it to
      illustrate possible scientific product.  Current
      models of comets do not indicate a major
      amplification of the cometary magnetic field over
      the solar-wind value.  However, major changes in
      field-line direction are expected.  Well away from
      the comet the magnetic field should, on average,
      show the Archimedian spiral angle of 135deg or
      315deg to the radial appropriate for normal
      solar-wind flow.  Interior to the bow shock we
      expect a different, possibly somewhat chaotic,
      orientation tending to the ordered two-lobed
      configuration along the axis of the plasma tail.
      If the neutral sheet is encountered, a magnetic
      reversal should be recorded.  The model-dependent
      nature of this description must be stressed.  For
      example, the bow shock may or may not exist.  We
      should know after 11 September 1985, and the model
      will be tested in this and in other respects.
      Obviously, we need data from as many different
      experiments as possible to complete our model
      testing.  To enhance the science return from the
      encounter, a Guest Investigator Program has been
      established by NASA.]]></field>

    ===========================
 
      The third International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE-3)
      was launched on 12 August 1978 as one element of a
      three-spacecraft mission that began in 1977.  The
      original purpose was to study the solar-wind
      interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere.  The
      spacecraft was maintained in a `halo orbit' about
      the libration point, L1, where it monitored the
      solar-wind input.  It completed four years of
      uninterrupted operation at that location.  Several
      opportunities to use ISEE-3 in an extended mission
      phase were available.  Among the most attractive
      scientifically were exploration of the distant
      geotail and an intercept of periodic Comet
      Giacobini-Zinner.  Either or both of these options
      were available.  The comet option was constrained
      to an intercept of Giacobini-Zinner in September
      1985; specifically, an intercept of Comet Halley
      was not possible.  In order to explore the comet
      option, a subcommittee of the ISEE Science Working
      Team (SWT) was formed at the request of the ISEE-3
      Project Scientist, T.  von Rosenvinge, and chaired
      by E. Smith.  The subcommittee and the SWT as a
      whole found the option to be of considerable
      scientific interest, and a report entitled
      `Intercept of Giacobini-Zinner by ISEE' was issued
      in June 1982, and revised in May 1983.  An ad hoc
      subcommittee of the Space Science Board recommended
      that NASA proceed with both the geotail option and
      the comet intercept.  After an in-house review and
      a review of the readiness of the spacecraft to
      perform the intercept by the Goddard Space Flight
      Center, NASA approved the intercept with Comet
      Giacobini-Zinner.  The maneuvers necessary to
      achieve the trajectory that would send the
      spacecraft into the distant geomagnetic tail and to
      an intercept of Comet Giacobini-Zinner are not
      simple.  They are the brainchild of R.  Farquhar,
      Flight Director for the Project.  Basically, five
      gravitational encounters with the Moon were
      required to change the spacecraft's orbit.  The
      last encounter was on 22 December 1983 when the
      spacecraft made a close swingby passing only 120 km
      above the lunar surface.  This manoeuvre
      effectively 'launched' the spacecraft from the
      Earth-Moon system.  At the same time, the
      spacecraft was renamed the International Cometary
      Explorer (ICE) to correspond to its new mission.]]></field>

  ================
 
    The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft was launched from Cape
    Canaveral Air Force Station on 12 August 2005 aboard a Lockheed-Martin
    Atlas V-401 launch vehicle. After a five-month cruise and a two-month
    approach to Mars, MRO entered Mars' orbit on 10 March 2006 and began
    aerobraking.  The primary science phase began on 8 November, 2006.
 
 
  Mission Phases
  ==============
 
    The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Mission is divided in time into seven
    phases: Launch, Cruise, Approach and Orbit Insertion, Aerobraking,
    Primary Science, Extended Science, and Relay.
 
    LAUNCH
    ------
      Launch extended from the start of the countdown to the initial
      acquisition, by the DSN, of the orbiter in a safe and stable
      configuration.
 
      The baseline launch vehicle for the MRO mission was the Lockheed-Martin
      Atlas V 401.  This launch vehicle was selected by NASA-KSC (Kennedy
      Space Flight Center) via a competitive procurement under the NASA
      Launch Services (NLS) contract.  The Atlas V 401 was a two-stage
      launch vehicle consisting of the Atlas Common Core Booster and a
      single engine Centaur upper stage.  The Centaur upper stage could
      perform multiple restarts of its main engine.  For precise pointing and
      control during coast and powered flight, the Centaur used a flight
      control system that was 3-axis stabilized. The Atlas large payload
      fairing was used to protect MRO during the Atlas boost phase.  This
      fairing had a diameter of 4.2m and a length of 12.2m.
 
      The launch and injection of MRO occured during the Mars opportunity
      of August 2005. The Atlas booster, in combination with the Centaur
      upper stage, delivered the MRO spacecraft into a targeted parking
      orbit. After a short coast, a restart of the Centaur upper stage
      injected MRO onto an interplanetary transfer trajectory.
 
      Mission Phase Start Time : 2005-08-12
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2005-08-12
 
    CRUISE
    ------
      Duration: About five months. The cruise phase extended from DSN
      initial acquisition, in a safe and stable configuration, until two
      months prior to the Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) maneuver. Primary
      activities during cruise included spacecraft and payload checkout and
      calibration.  These activities, along with daily monitoring of orbiter
      subsystems, were performed in order to fully characterize the
      performance of the spacecraft and its payload prior to arrival at
      Mars.  In addition, standard navigation activities were performed
      during this flight phase, the first being the largest TCM performed
      fifteen days after launch.
 
      Mission Phase Start Time : 2005-08-12
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2006-01-10
 
    APPROACH AND ORBIT INSERTION
    ----------------------------
      This phase extended from two months prior to Mars Orbit Insertion
      (MOI), through MOI, and until the orbiter was checked out and ready to
      begin aerobraking. The orbiter was inserted into a nearly polar orbit
      with a period of 35 hours.
 
      During the last sixty days of the interplanetary transit, spacecraft
      and ground activities were focused on the events necessary for a
      successful arrival and safe capture at Mars. Navigation techniques
      included the use of delta-DOR measurements in the orbit determination.
      This technique yielded a precise determination of the inbound
      trajectory with a series of final TCMs used to control the flight path
      of the spacecraft up to the MOI maneuver.
 
      Also during the approach phase, MRO performed the Optical Navigation
      experiment.  This involved pointing the optical navigation camera
      (ONC) at the moons of Mars - Phobos and Deimos, and tracking their
      motion. By comparing the observed position of the moons to their
      predicted positions, relative to the background stars, the ground was
      able to accurately determine the position of the orbiter.
 
      Upon arrival at Mars on March 10, 2006, the spacecraft performed its
      MOI maneuver using its six main engines.  MOI inserted the spacecraft
      into an initial, highly elliptical capture orbit.  The delta-V
      required to accomplish this critical maneuver was 1015 m/s and took
      about 26 minutes to complete. For most of the burn, the orbiter was
      visible from the DSN stations.  The signal was occulted as the orbiter
      went behind Mars, and appeared again a short time later. The reference
      MRO capture orbit had a period of 35 hours and a periapsis altitude of
      300km.  The orientation of the ascending node was 8:30 PM LMST.  The
      capture orbit was been selected such that aerobraking would be
      completed prior to the start of solar conjunction (September 23,
      2006).
 
      Mission Phase Start Time : 2006-01-10
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2006-03-10
 
 
    AEROBRAKING
    -----------
      The Aerobraking Phase of the mission consisted of three sub-phases,
      Aerobraking Operations, Transition to PSO Operations, and Solar
      Conjunction.
 
      Aerobraking Operations Sub-Phase
      --------------------------------
 
      One week after MOI, aerobraking operations commenced.  During this
      time period, the orbiter used aerobraking techniques to supplement its
      onboard propulsive capability and to reduce its orbit period to that
      necessary for the primary science orbit (PSO).  Aerobraking Operations
      consisted of a walk-in phase, a main phase, and a walkout phase, and
      was followed by a transition to the PSO.  During the walk-in phase, the
      spacecraft established initial contact with the atmosphere as the
      periapsis altitude of the orbit was slowly lowered.  The walk-in phase
      continued until the dynamic pressures and heating rate values required
      for main phase, or steady state aerobraking, were established.  During
      the main phase of aerobraking operations, large scale orbit period
      reduction occurred as the orbiter was guided to dynamic pressure
      limits. Main phase aerobraking continued until the orbit lifetime of
      the orbiter reached 2 days.  (Orbit lifetime is defined as the time it
      takes the apoapsis altitude of the orbit to decay to an altitude of
      300km.)  When the orbit lifetime of the orbiter reached 2 days, the
      walkout phase of aerobraking operations began.  During the walkout
      phase, the periapsis altitude of the orbit was slowly increased as the
      2 day orbit lifetime of the orbiter was maintained.  Once the orbit of
      the orbiter reached an apoapsis altitude of 450km, the orbiter
      terminated aerobraking by propulsively raising the periapsis of its
      orbit out of the atmosphere.
 
      Because the PSO had nodal orientation requirements, the aerobraking
      phase of the MRO mission had to proceed in a timely manner and be
      completed near the time the desired nodal geometry was achieved. After
      approximately 4.5 months of aerobraking, the dynamic pressure control
      limits were reset such that the orbiter will fly to the desired 3:00
      pm LMST nodal target.
 
      Transition to PSO Operations Sub-Phase
      --------------------------------------
 
      Once the orbit apoapsis altitude was reduced to 450 km, the orbiter
      terminated aerobraking by raising periapsis to a safe altitude and
      begin a transition to the Primary Science Phase.  The periapsis of
      the transition orbit rotated around Mars from over the equatorial
      latitudes to the North Pole.  When periapsis reached the North Pole,
      apoapsis was reduced propulsively to 255 km and orbit rotation stopped
      - the orbit was frozen with periapsis over the South Pole and apoapsis
      over the North Pole.  The SHARAD antenna and the CRISM cover were
      deployed, the instruments were checked out and remaining calibrations
      were performed.  The payloads collected data in their normal operating
      modes to ensure that the end-to-end data collection and processing
      systems worked as planned.
 
      Solar Conjuction Sub-Phase
      --------------------------
 
      Orbiter activities in preparation for science were then temporarily
      suspended during a four week period surrounding solar conjunction.

      The 255 x 320 km Primary Science Orbit (PSO) was a near-polar orbit
      with periapsis frozen over the South Pole.  It was sun-synchronous with
      an ascending node orientation that provided a Local Mean Solar Time
      (LMST) of 3:00 p.m. at the equator.  Because of the eccentricity of
      the Mars orbit around the Sun, true solar time varied by nearly 45
      minutes over the course of one Mars year.
 
      The Primary Science Phase of the mission began after solar conjunction
      and after turn-on and checkout of the science instruments in the
      Primary Science Orbit.  The phase started on 8 November 2006 and
      extended for about one Mars year, through December 19, 2008.
 
      The science investigations were functionally divided into daily global
      mapping and profiling, regional survey, and globally distributed
      targeting investigations.  The global mapping instruments were the MCS
      and the MARCI.  The targeted investigations were HiRISE, CRISM, and
      CTX. The survey investigations were CRISM and CTX (in survey modes),
      and SHARAD.  The global mapping instruments required nadir pointing,
      low data rate, and continuous or near-continuous operations.  The
      global mapping investigations were expected to use less than 5% of the
      expected downlink data volume.  The targeted and survey instruments
      were high data rate instruments and required precise targeting in
      along-track timing and/or cross-track pointing for short periods of
      time over selected portions of the surface.  More than 95% of the
      available downlink data volume was expected to be used for
      targeted and survey investigations. All instruments were able to take
      data simultaneously.
 
      The Phoenix lander arrived at Mars on May 25, 2008. Phoenix used
      MRO to characterize its prime landing site choices early in the
      Primary Science Phase. MRO also provided relay support for Entry,
      Descent, and Landing (EDL) activities and for telecommunications late
      in the PSP after Phoenix arrived at Mars.
      Phoenix and MRO also coordinated some observations to maximize
      science return to the Mars Exploration Program.
 
      NASA may approve, as resources and on-orbit capability permit,
      continuation of science observations beyond the Primary Science Phase
      until end of the Relay Phase (also End of Mission).  The orbiter will
      remain in the Primary Science Orbit during the Relay Phase.
 
      Mission Phase Start Time : 2006-11-08
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2008-12-19
 
 
    EXTENDED SCIENCE
    ---------------
      NASA approved continuation of science observations after the Primary
      Science Phase ended. MRO operations are continuing in the Extended
      Science Phase, which is funded for another Mars year. MRO carries
      enough fuel to continue operating for several more years.

    RELAY
    -----
      MRO provides critical relay support to missions launched as part
      of the Mars Exploration Program after MRO.  For spacecraft launched in
      the 2007 opportunity, this relay support occurred before the end of
      the MRO Primary Science Phase.   Following completion of the Primary
      and Extended Science Phases, MRO will continue to provide critical
      relay support for Mars missions until its end of mission.
 
      The Phoenix lander arrived at Mars on May 25, 2008. MRO provided
      science imaging support for site characterization and selection
      and relay support for Phoenix Entry,
      Descent and Landing activities and for its science data return.
      Another mission, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) was originally
      proposed for the 2009 Mars launch opportunity but has been delayed
      until the 2011 opportunity.  MSL will also need science imaging support
      for site characterization and selection and relay support for EDL and
      science data return.  The MRO Mission Plan describes the generic
      support activities for any mission as well as current early planning
      in support of Phoenix and MSL.
 
      The orbiter has been designed to carry enough propellant to remain
      operational for 5 years beyond the end-of-mission (EOM) on December
      31, 2010 to support future MEP missions.  As this is beyond the EOM,
      no activities have been planned for this time period.  To ensure that
      the orbiter remains in a viable orbit during this time, its orbit
      altitude will be increased at EOM to about 20 km inside the orbit of
      the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft.
 
      The MRO approach to planetary protection differs from any previous
      Mars orbiter.  The NASA requirements for planetary protection,
      NPG8020.12B, allow a class III mission, like MRO, to use either the
      'probability of impact/orbit lifetime' or a 'total bio burden'
      approach.  Implementing the Level 1 MRO requirements with the
      instruments selected via the NASA AO requires low orbits whose
      lifetimes are incompatible with a 'probability of impact/orbit
      lifetime' approach to Planetary Protection.  Therefore, MRO is
      implementing the requirements of NPG8020.12B using the 'total
      bio-burden' approach.  This approach has been documented in the MRO
      Planetary Protection Plan (D-23711). The details of cleaning
      requirements are documented in the MRO Planetary Protection
      Implementation Plan, MRO 212-11, JPL D-22688. The MRO launch targets
      will be biased away from a direct intercept course with Mars to ensure
      a less than 1 in 10,000 chance of the launch vehicle upper stage
      entering Mars atmosphere.
 
      The End-of-Mission (EOM) is planned for December 31, 2010 just prior
      to the third solar conjunction of the mission.  The orbiter will
      perform a propulsive maneuver to place itself in a higher orbit to
      increase the orbit lifetime and enable extended mission operations.

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
 
    The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft was launched from Cape
    Canaveral Air Force Station on 12 August 2005 aboard a Lockheed-Martin
    Atlas V-401 launch vehicle. After a five-month cruise and a two-month
    approach to Mars, MRO entered Mars' orbit on 10 March 2006 and began
    aerobraking.  The primary science phase began on 8 November, 2006.
 
 
  Mission Phases
  ==============
 
    The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Mission is divided in time into seven
    phases: Launch, Cruise, Approach and Orbit Insertion, Aerobraking,
    Primary Science, Extended Science, and Relay.
 
    LAUNCH
    ------
      Launch extended from the start of the countdown to the initial
      acquisition, by the DSN, of the orbiter in a safe and stable
      configuration.
 
      The baseline launch vehicle for the MRO mission was the Lockheed-Martin
      Atlas V 401.  This launch vehicle was selected by NASA-KSC (Kennedy
      Space Flight Center) via a competitive procurement under the NASA
      Launch Services (NLS) contract.  The Atlas V 401 was a two-stage
      launch vehicle consisting of the Atlas Common Core Booster and a
      single engine Centaur upper stage.  The Centaur upper stage could
      perform multiple restarts of its main engine.  For precise pointing and
      control during coast and powered flight, the Centaur used a flight
      control system that was 3-axis stabilized. The Atlas large payload
      fairing was used to protect MRO during the Atlas boost phase.  This
      fairing had a diameter of 4.2m and a length of 12.2m.
 
      The launch and injection of MRO occured during the Mars opportunity
      of August 2005. The Atlas booster, in combination with the Centaur
      upper stage, delivered the MRO spacecraft into a targeted parking
      orbit. After a short coast, a restart of the Centaur upper stage
      injected MRO onto an interplanetary transfer trajectory.
 
      Mission Phase Start Time : 2005-08-12
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2005-08-12
 
    CRUISE
    ------
      Duration: About five months. The cruise phase extended from DSN
      initial acquisition, in a safe and stable configuration, until two
      months prior to the Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) maneuver. Primary
      activities during cruise included spacecraft and payload checkout and
      calibration.  These activities, along with daily monitoring of orbiter
      subsystems, were performed in order to fully characterize the
      performance of the spacecraft and its payload prior to arrival at
      Mars.  In addition, standard navigation activities were performed
      during this flight phase, the first being the largest TCM performed
      fifteen days after launch.
 
      Mission Phase Start Time : 2005-08-12
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2006-01-10
 
    APPROACH AND ORBIT INSERTION
    ----------------------------
      This phase extended from two months prior to Mars Orbit Insertion
      (MOI), through MOI, and until the orbiter was checked out and ready to
      begin aerobraking. The orbiter was inserted into a nearly polar orbit
      with a period of 35 hours.
 
      During the last sixty days of the interplanetary transit, spacecraft
      and ground activities were focused on the events necessary for a
      successful arrival and safe capture at Mars. Navigation techniques
      included the use of delta-DOR measurements in the orbit determination.
      This technique yielded a precise determination of the inbound
      trajectory with a series of final TCMs used to control the flight path
      of the spacecraft up to the MOI maneuver.
 
      Also during the approach phase, MRO performed the Optical Navigation
      experiment.  This involved pointing the optical navigation camera
      (ONC) at the moons of Mars - Phobos and Deimos, and tracking their
      motion. By comparing the observed position of the moons to their
      predicted positions, relative to the background stars, the ground was
      able to accurately determine the position of the orbiter.
 
      Upon arrival at Mars on March 10, 2006, the spacecraft performed its
      MOI maneuver using its six main engines.  MOI inserted the spacecraft
      into an initial, highly elliptical capture orbit.  The delta-V
      required to accomplish this critical maneuver was 1015 m/s and took
      about 26 minutes to complete. For most of the burn, the orbiter was
      visible from the DSN stations.  The signal was occulted as the orbiter
      went behind Mars, and appeared again a short time later. The reference
      MRO capture orbit had a period of 35 hours and a periapsis altitude of
      300km.  The orientation of the ascending node was 8:30 PM LMST.  The
      capture orbit was been selected such that aerobraking would be
      completed prior to the start of solar conjunction (September 23,
      2006).
 
      Mission Phase Start Time : 2006-01-10
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2006-03-10
 
 
    AEROBRAKING
    -----------
      The Aerobraking Phase of the mission consisted of three sub-phases,
      Aerobraking Operations, Transition to PSO Operations, and Solar
      Conjunction.
 
      Aerobraking Operations Sub-Phase
      --------------------------------
 
      One week after MOI, aerobraking operations commenced.  During this
      time period, the orbiter used aerobraking techniques to supplement its
      onboard propulsive capability and to reduce its orbit period to that
      necessary for the primary science orbit (PSO).  Aerobraking Operations
      consisted of a walk-in phase, a main phase, and a walkout phase, and
      was followed by a transition to the PSO.  During the walk-in phase, the
      spacecraft established initial contact with the atmosphere as the
      periapsis altitude of the orbit was slowly lowered.  The walk-in phase
      continued until the dynamic pressures and heating rate values required
      for main phase, or steady state aerobraking, were established.  During
      the main phase of aerobraking operations, large scale orbit period
      reduction occurred as the orbiter was guided to dynamic pressure
      limits. Main phase aerobraking continued until the orbit lifetime of
      the orbiter reached 2 days.  (Orbit lifetime is defined as the time it
      takes the apoapsis altitude of the orbit to decay to an altitude of
      300km.)  When the orbit lifetime of the orbiter reached 2 days, the
      walkout phase of aerobraking operations began.  During the walkout
      phase, the periapsis altitude of the orbit was slowly increased as the
      2 day orbit lifetime of the orbiter was maintained.  Once the orbit of
      the orbiter reached an apoapsis altitude of 450km, the orbiter
      terminated aerobraking by propulsively raising the periapsis of its
      orbit out of the atmosphere.
 
      Because the PSO had nodal orientation requirements, the aerobraking
      phase of the MRO mission had to proceed in a timely manner and be
      completed near the time the desired nodal geometry was achieved. After
      approximately 4.5 months of aerobraking, the dynamic pressure control
      limits were reset such that the orbiter will fly to the desired 3:00
      pm LMST nodal target.
 
      Transition to PSO Operations Sub-Phase
      --------------------------------------
 
      Once the orbit apoapsis altitude was reduced to 450 km, the orbiter
      terminated aerobraking by raising periapsis to a safe altitude and
      begin a transition to the Primary Science Phase.  The periapsis of
      the transition orbit rotated around Mars from over the equatorial
      latitudes to the North Pole.  When periapsis reached the North Pole,
      apoapsis was reduced propulsively to 255 km and orbit rotation stopped
      - the orbit was frozen with periapsis over the South Pole and apoapsis
      over the North Pole.  The SHARAD antenna and the CRISM cover were
      deployed, the instruments were checked out and remaining calibrations
      were performed.  The payloads collected data in their normal operating
      modes to ensure that the end-to-end data collection and processing
      systems worked as planned.
 
      Solar Conjuction Sub-Phase
      --------------------------
 
      Orbiter activities in preparation for science were then temporarily
      suspended during a four week period surrounding solar conjunction.

    PRIMARY SCIENCE
    ---------------
      The 255 x 320 km Primary Science Orbit (PSO) was a near-polar orbit
      with periapsis frozen over the South Pole.  It was sun-synchronous with
      an ascending node orientation that provided a Local Mean Solar Time
      (LMST) of 3:00 p.m. at the equator.  Because of the eccentricity of
      the Mars orbit around the Sun, true solar time varied by nearly 45
      minutes over the course of one Mars year.
 
      The Primary Science Phase of the mission began after solar conjunction
      and after turn-on and checkout of the science instruments in the
      Primary Science Orbit.  The phase started on 8 November 2006 and
      extended for about one Mars year, through December 19, 2008.
 
      The science investigations were functionally divided into daily global
      mapping and profiling, regional survey, and globally distributed
      targeting investigations.  The global mapping instruments were the MCS
      and the MARCI.  The targeted investigations were HiRISE, CRISM, and
      CTX. The survey investigations were CRISM and CTX (in survey modes),
      and SHARAD.  The global mapping instruments required nadir pointing,
      low data rate, and continuous or near-continuous operations.  The
      global mapping investigations were expected to use less than 5% of the
      expected downlink data volume.  The targeted and survey instruments
      were high data rate instruments and required precise targeting in
      along-track timing and/or cross-track pointing for short periods of
      time over selected portions of the surface.  More than 95% of the
      available downlink data volume was expected to be used for
      targeted and survey investigations. All instruments were able to take
      data simultaneously.
 
      The Phoenix lander arrived at Mars on May 25, 2008. Phoenix used
      MRO to characterize its prime landing site choices early in the
      Primary Science Phase. MRO also provided relay support for Entry,
      Descent, and Landing (EDL) activities and for telecommunications late
      in the PSP after Phoenix arrived at Mars.
      Phoenix and MRO also coordinated some observations to maximize
      science return to the Mars Exploration Program.
 
      NASA may approve, as resources and on-orbit capability permit,
      continuation of science observations beyond the Primary Science Phase
      until end of the Relay Phase (also End of Mission).  The orbiter will
      remain in the Primary Science Orbit during the Relay Phase.
 
      Mission Phase Start Time : 2006-11-08
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2008-12-19
 
 
    EXTENDED SCIENCE
    ---------------
      NASA approved continuation of science observations after the Primary
      Science Phase ended. MRO operations are continuing in the Extended
      Science Phase, which is funded for another Mars year. MRO carries
      enough fuel to continue operating for several more years.
 
      Mission Phase Start Time : 2008-12-20
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2010-12-19
 
 
    RELAY
    -----
      MRO provides critical relay support to missions launched as part
      of the Mars Exploration Program after MRO.  For spacecraft launched in
      the 2007 opportunity, this relay support occurred before the end of
      the MRO Primary Science Phase.   Following completion of the Primary
      and Extended Science Phases, MRO will continue to provide critical
      relay support for Mars missions until its end of mission.
 
      The Phoenix lander arrived at Mars on May 25, 2008. MRO provided
      science imaging support for site characterization and selection
      and relay support for Phoenix Entry,
      Descent and Landing activities and for its science data return.
      Another mission, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) was originally
      proposed for the 2009 Mars launch opportunity but has been delayed
      until the 2011 opportunity.  MSL will also need science imaging support
      for site characterization and selection and relay support for EDL and
      science data return.  The MRO Mission Plan describes the generic
      support activities for any mission as well as current early planning
      in support of Phoenix and MSL.
 
      The orbiter has been designed to carry enough propellant to remain
      operational for 5 years beyond the end-of-mission (EOM) on December
      31, 2010 to support future MEP missions.  As this is beyond the EOM,
      no activities have been planned for this time period.  To ensure that
      the orbiter remains in a viable orbit during this time, its orbit
      altitude will be increased at EOM to about 20 km inside the orbit of
      the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft.
 
      The MRO approach to planetary protection differs from any previous
      Mars orbiter.  The NASA requirements for planetary protection,
      NPG8020.12B, allow a class III mission, like MRO, to use either the
      'probability of impact/orbit lifetime' or a 'total bio burden'
      approach.  Implementing the Level 1 MRO requirements with the
      instruments selected via the NASA AO requires low orbits whose
      lifetimes are incompatible with a 'probability of impact/orbit
      lifetime' approach to Planetary Protection.  Therefore, MRO is
      implementing the requirements of NPG8020.12B using the 'total
      bio-burden' approach.  This approach has been documented in the MRO
      Planetary Protection Plan (D-23711). The details of cleaning
      requirements are documented in the MRO Planetary Protection
      Implementation Plan, MRO 212-11, JPL D-22688. The MRO launch targets
      will be biased away from a direct intercept course with Mars to ensure
      a less than 1 in 10,000 chance of the launch vehicle upper stage
      entering Mars atmosphere.
 
      The End-of-Mission (EOM) is planned for December 31, 2010 just prior
      to the third solar conjunction of the mission.  The orbiter will
      perform a propulsive maneuver to place itself in a higher orbit to
      increase the orbit lifetime and enable extended mission operations.

<field name="investigation_objectives_summary"><![CDATA[The driving theme of the Mars Exploration Program is to understand the
  role of water on Mars and its implications for possible past or
  current biological activity.  The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)
  Project will pursue this 'Follow-the-Water' strategy by conducting
  remote sensing observations that return sets of globally distributed
  data that will:  1) advance our understanding of the current Mars
  climate, the processes that have formed and modified the surface of
  the planet, and the extent to which water has played a role in surface
  processes; 2) identify sites of possible aqueous activity indicating
  environments that may have been or are conducive to biological
  activity; and 3) thus identify and characterize sites for future
  landed missions.
 
  The MRO payload is designed to conduct remote sensing science
  observations, identify and characterize sites for future landers, and
  provide critical telecom/navigation relay capability for follow-on
  missions.  The mission will provide global, regional survey, and
  targeted observations from a low 255 km by 320 km Mars orbit with a
  3:00 P.M. local mean solar time (ascending node).  During the one
  Martian year (687 Earth days) primary science phase, the orbiter will
  acquire visual and near-infrared high-resolution images of the
  planet's surface, monitor atmospheric weather and climate, and search
  the upper crust for evidence of water.  After this science phase is
  completed, the orbiter will provide telecommunications support for
  spacecraft launched to Mars in the 2007 and 2009 opportunities.  The
  primary mission will end on December 31, 2010, approximately 5.5 years
  after launch.
 
 
  Science Questions Addressed
  ---------------------------
 
    The MRO mission has the primary objective of placing a science orbiter
    into Mars orbit to perform remote sensing investigations that will
    characterize the surface, subsurface and atmosphere of the planet and
    will identify potential landing sites for future missions.  The MRO
    payload will conduct observations in many parts of the electromagnetic
    spectrum, including ultraviolet and visible imaging, visible to
    near-infrared imaging spectrometry, thermal infrared atmospheric
    profiling, and radar subsurface sounding, at spatial resolutions
    substantially better than any preceding Mars orbiter.  In pursuit of
    its science objectives, the MRO mission will:
 
    - Characterize Mars' seasonal cycles and diurnal variations of water,
      dust, and carbon dioxide.
    - Characterize Mars' global atmospheric structure, transport, and
      surface changes.
    - Search sites for evidence of aqueous and/or hydrothermal activity.
    - Observe and characterize the detailed stratigraphy, geologic
      structure, and composition of Mars surface features.
    - Probe the near-surface Martian crust to detect subsurface structure,
      including layering and potential reservoirs of water and/or water ice
    - Characterize the Martian gravity field in greater detail relative to
      previous Mars missions to improve knowledge of the Martian crust and
      lithosphere and potentially of atmospheric mass variation.
    - Identify and characterize numerous globally distributed landing sites
      with a high potential for scientific discovery by future missions.
 
    In addition, MRO will provide critical telecommunications relay
    capability for follow-on missions and will conduct, on a
    non-interference basis with the primary mission science, telecom and
    navigation demonstrations in support of future Mars Exploration
    Program (MEP) activities.  Specifically, the MRO mission will:
 
    - Provide navigation and data relay support services to future MEP
      missions.
    - Demonstrate Optical Navigation techniques for high precision delivery
      of future landed missions.
    - Perform an operational demonstration of high data rate Ka-band
      telecommunications and navigation services.
 
    Designed to operate after launch for at least 5.4 years, the MRO
    orbiter will use a new spacecraft bus design provided by Lockheed
    Martin Space Systems Company, Space Exploration Systems Division in
    Denver, Colorado.  The orbiter payload will consist of six science
    instruments and three new engineering payload elements listed as
    follows:
 
    Science Instruments
    - HiRISE, High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment
    - CRISM, Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars
    - MCS, Mars Climate Sounder
    - MARCI, Mars Color Imager
    - CTX, Context Camera
    - SHARAD, Shallow (Subsurface) Radar
 
    Engineering Payloads
    - Electra UHF communications and navigation package
    - Optical Navigation (Camera) Experiment
    - Ka Band Telecommunication Experiment
 
    To fulfill the mission science goals, seven scientific investigations
    teams were selected by NASA.  Four teams (MARCI, MCS, HiRISE, and
    CRISM) are led by Principal Investigators (PI), each responsible for
    the provision and operation of a scientific instrument and the
    analysis of its data.  The MARCI PI and Science Team also act to
    provide and operate, as Team Leader (TL) and Team Members, the CTX
    facility instrument that will provide context imaging for HiRISE and
    CRISM, as well as acquire and analyze independent data in support of
    the MRO scientific objectives.  The Italian Space Agency (ASI) will
    provide a second facility instrument, SHARAD, for flight on MRO.  ASI
    and NASA have both selected members of the SHARAD investigation team.
    In addition to the instrument investigations, Gravity Science and
    Atmospheric Structure Facility Investigation Teams will use data from
    the spacecraft telecommunications and accelerometers, respectively, to
    conduct scientific investigations.
 
    The MRO shall accomplish its science objectives by conducting an
    integrated program of three distinct observational modes:
 
    - Daily global mapping and profiling observations
    - Regional survey observations, and
    - Globally distributed, targeted observations
 
    These observation modes will be intermixed and often overlapping.
    Some instruments have more than one observational mode.  In addition,
    many targeted observations will involve nearly simultaneous,
    coordinated observations by more than one instrument.  This program of
    scientific observation will be carried out for one Mars year or more
    in order to characterize the full seasonal variation of the Martian
    climate and to target hundreds of globally distributed sites with high
    potential for further scientific discovery.
 
 Mission Success Criteria
 ------------------------
 
    The following mission success criteria have been established for the
    MRO Project. The mission success criteria are described and controlled
    in the MRO Project Implementation Plan.
 
    For Full Mission Success, the following criteria must be met:
 
    - Operate the orbiter and all six (6) science instruments in the
    Primary Science Orbit in targeting, survey and mapping modes, as
    appropriate, over the one Mars year of the Primary Science Phase;
    conduct the gravity and accelerometer investigations. Each science
    instrument shall have capabilities that meet or exceed their
    respective science instrument requirements.
 
    - Return, over the one-Mars-year Primary Science Phase, representative
    data sets for each instrument for a total science data volume return
    of 26 Tbits or more. Included in the returned data volume shall be
    information describing hundreds of globally distributed targets.
 
    - Process, analyze, interpret, and release data in a timely manner,
    including archival of acquired data and standard data products in the
    PDS within 6 months of acquisition or as negotiated in the Science
    Data Management Plan (JPL D22218).
 
    - Conduct relay operations for U.S. spacecraft launched to Mars in the
    2007 and 2009 opportunities.
 
 
    For Minimum Mission Success, the following criteria must be met:
 
    - Operate the orbiter and its science payload in targeting, survey and
    mapping modes, as appropriate, in the Primary Science Orbit during the
    one-Mars-year of the Primary Science Phase; conduct gravity and
    accelerometer investigations. Science instruments shall have
    capabilities that meet their respective science instrument
    requirements.
 
    - Return 10 Tbits of science data from HiRISE or CRISM or from their
    combined operations, plus 5 Tbits of representative science data over
    the one-Mars-year Primary Science Phase from at least 3 of the 4 other
    instruments (CTX, MARCI, MCS, SHARAD); conduct gravity and
    accelerometer investigations. Included in the returned data volumes
    shall be information describing 100 or more globally distributed
    targets.
 
    - Process, analyze, interpret, and release data in a timely manner,
    including archival of acquired data and standard data products in the
    PDS.
 
    - Conduct relay operations for U.S. spacecraft launched to Mars in the
    2007 and 2009 opportunities.]]></field>

      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.                            
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
Review                                                                
======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the VEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the VEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered that for IFMS the file naming convention of   
      AGC raw files was crossed since beginning of the Mars Express   
      mission.                                                        
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.             
      In general, this is a good data set.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science            
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).        
                                                                              
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data             
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for                   
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of              
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface               
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS                
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,                     
      as appropriate.                                                         
                                                                              
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford              
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both            
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the             
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data from ESA  
      and thus level 1a and level 1b Doppler data may contain a wrong uplink  
      frequency. This problem was identified during processing and corrected  
      for level 2 data. If this problem occurred the folder                   
      UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the CALIB directory            
      containing information which raw files were effected and where to find  
      the corrected data.                                                     
                                                                              
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file naming    
      convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning of the          
      mission.                                                                
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other        
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were swapped     
      during the whole processing.                                            
                                                                              
      Quality of data was affected by anomalous conditions.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.                            
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
Review                                                                
======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.                            
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
Review                                                                
======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.                            
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
Review                                                                
======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.                            
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
Review                                                                
======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
      On 15.8.2007 the PI of Radio Science moved to another institute.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.                            
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
Review                                                                
======                                                                
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of           
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.             
      In general, this is a good data set.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science            
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).        
                                                                              
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data             
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for                   
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of              
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface               
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS                
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,                     
      as appropriate.                                                         
                                                                              
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford              
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both            
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the             
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data from ESA  
      and thus level 1a and level 1b Doppler data may contain a wrong uplink  
      frequency. This problem was identified during processing and corrected  
      for level 2 data. If this problem occurred the folder                   
      UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the CALIB directory            
      containing information which raw files were effected and where to find  
      the corrected data.                                                     
                                                                              
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file naming    
      convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning of the          
      mission.                                                                
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other        
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were swapped     
      during the whole processing.                                            
                                                                              
      Quality of data was affected by anomalous conditions.                   
                                                                              
      Examples include:

      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of           
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.             
      In general, this is a good data set.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science            
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).        
                                                                              
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data             
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for                   
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of              
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface               
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS                
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,                     
      as appropriate.                                                         
                                                                              
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data from ESA  
      and thus level 1a and level 1b Doppler data may contain a wrong uplink  
      frequency. This problem was identified during processing and corrected  
      for level 2 data. If this problem occurred the folder                   
      UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the CALIB directory            
      containing information which raw files were effected and where to find  
      the corrected data.                                                     
                                                                              
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file naming    
      convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning of the          
      mission.                                                                
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other        
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were swapped     
      during the whole processing.                                            
                                                                              
      Quality of data was affected by anomalous conditions.

========                                                              
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of           
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.             
      In general, this is a good data set.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science            
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).        
                                                                              
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data             
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for                   
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of              
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface               
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS                
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,                     
      as appropriate.                                                         
                                                                              
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford              
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both            
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the             
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data from ESA  
      and thus level 1a and level 1b Doppler data may contain a wrong uplink  
      frequency. This problem was identified during processing and corrected  
      for level 2 data. If this problem occurred the folder                   
      UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the CALIB directory            
      containing information which raw files were effected and where to find  
      the corrected data.                                                     
                                                                              
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file naming    
      convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning of the          
      mission.                                                                
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other        
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were swapped     
      during the whole processing.                                            
                                                                              
      Quality of data was affected by anomalous conditions.

========                                                          
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

======                                                            
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                             
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data from ESA 
      and thus level 1a and level 1b Doppler data may contain a wrong uplink 
      frequency. This problem was identified during processing and corrected 
      for level 2 data. If this problem occurred the folder 
      UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the CALIB directory 
      containing information which raw files were effected and where to find 
      the corrected data.
             
      Quality of data was affected by anomalous conditions.

      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of   
      health monitoring activities of the MEX Radio Science Team.     
      In general, this is a good data set.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the MEX Radio Science    
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
                                                                      
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data     
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for           
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of      
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface       
      Specifications.  These materials were distributed to PDS        
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,             
      as appropriate.                                                 
                                                                      
      ODR files on the CD-WO volumes were checked using Stanford      
      parsing and reduction software to ensure that they were both    
      complete and accurate replicas of the data contained in the     
      original files.

      Most notably it was discovered that the incoming Doppler data   
      from ESA and thus level 1A and level 1B Doppler data may contain
      a wrong uplink frequency. This problem was identified during    
      processing and corrected for level 2 data. If this problem      
      occurred the folder UPLINK_FREQ_CORRECT will be generated in the
      CALIB directory containing information which raw files were     
      effected and where to find the corrected data.                  
                                                                      
      It was discovered later in the mission that for IFMS the file   
      naming convention of AGC raw files was crossed since beginning  
      of the mission.                                                 
      In fact AGC1 refers to D2 and AG2 refers to D1 and not the other
      way around as it should be. Consequently the AGC files were     
      swapped during the whole processing.                            
                                                                      
      Please note, that for the New Norcia ground station (NNO) the   
      ESA station number is 74 wheras the DSN station number is 32.   
      This number is used in the labels and most documents. Some ESA  
      documents and especially orbit prediction files may use the     
      ESA station number.                                             
      Because of some problems with documentation on the U.S. side,   
      the navigation people are using 83 for Cebreros rather than 62, 
      the official station id; so you may see either number depending 
      on the source of the file.

    Data Source Descriptions
    ========================
 
    ELEMENTS-PLANET
   	The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page E3.
 
    MAGMOMENT-PLANET
   	C.T. RUSSELL, CH. 5 IN GEOMAGNETISM, VOL. 2 (ACADEMIC PRESS)
 
    MEANSOLARDAY-PLANET
   	Derived from three other target constants catalog elements:
   	REVOLUTION_PERIOD (RP), SIDEREAL_ROTATION_PERIOD (SRP), and
     	ROTATION_DIRECTION_TYPE (RDT)  as follows:
    	If RDT = PROGRADE, then MSD = (RP * SRP)/(RP - SRP).
    	If RDT = RETROGRADE, then MSD = (RP * SRP)/(RP + SRP).
 
    ORBSEMIMAJAX-PLANET
  	Derived from data from The 1989 Astronomical Almanac,
   	converting Mean Distance on page E3 to km using the value
   	for Unit Distance found on page K6.
 
    PERIARGANG-PLANET
   	Derived from data from The 1989 Astronomical Almanac as
    	LAN-LP, where LAN is the Ascending Node Longitude and LP is
   	the Longitude of Perihelion, both from page E3.
 
    PHYSICAL-PLANET
   	The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page E88.
   	The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page K6.
 
    RADIUS-PLANET
   	Taken or derived from REPORT OF THE IAU WORKING GROUP ON
   	CARTOGRAPHIC COORDINATES AND ROTATIONAL ELEMENTS OF THE
   	PLANETS AND SATELLITES, 1988 as follows:
   	Given Mean Radius (MR), Equatorial Radius (ER), and Polar
   	Radius (PR), then this catalog defines the following:
          A_AXIS_RADIUS        = ER
          B_AXIS_RADIUS        = ER
          C_AXIS_RADIUS        = ER
          FLATTENING           = (ER - PR)/ER
 
    REVPER-PLANET
   	Derived from data from The 1989 Astronomical Almanac as
   	360/n where n is the Daily Motion from page E3.
 
    ROTATION-PLANET
   	The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page E87.
   	The Astronomical Almanac, 1989, page C3.
 
    SURFGRAV-PLANET
   	Derived from data in THE 1989 ASTRONOMICAL ALMANAC and the
   	1988 REPORT OF THE IAU WORKING GROUP ON CARTOGRAPHIC
   	COORDINATES as (G * MASS)/(MR * MR) where MR is MEAN RADIUS
   	from this catalog, MASS comes from page E88, and the
   	gravitational constant, G, comes from page K6.]]></field>

    Data Source Descriptions
    ========================
 
    ELEMENTS-PLANET
   	The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page E3.
 
    MAGMOMENT-PLANET
   	C.T. RUSSELL, CH. 5 IN GEOMAGNETISM, VOL. 2 (ACADEMIC PRESS)
 
    MEANSOLARDAY-PLANET
   	Derived from three other target constants catalog elements:
   	REVOLUTION_PERIOD (RP), SIDEREAL_ROTATION_PERIOD (SRP), and
     	ROTATION_DIRECTION_TYPE (RDT)  as follows:
    	If RDT = PROGRADE, then MSD = (RP * SRP)/(RP - SRP).
    	If RDT = RETROGRADE, then MSD = (RP * SRP)/(RP + SRP).
 
    ORBSEMIMAJAX-PLANET
  	Derived from data from The 1989 Astronomical Almanac,
   	converting Mean Distance on page E3 to km using the value
   	for Unit Distance found on page K6.
 
    PERIARGANG-PLANET
   	Derived from data from The 1989 Astronomical Almanac as
    	LAN-LP, where LAN is the Ascending Node Longitude and LP is
   	the Longitude of Perihelion, both from page E3.
 
    PHYSICAL-PLANET
   	The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page E88.
   	The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page K6.
 
    RADIUS-PLANET
   	Taken or derived from REPORT OF THE IAU WORKING GROUP ON
   	CARTOGRAPHIC COORDINATES AND ROTATIONAL ELEMENTS OF THE
   	PLANETS AND SATELLITES, 1988 as follows:
   	Given Mean Radius (MR), Equatorial Radius (ER), and Polar
   	Radius (PR), then this catalog defines the following:
          A_AXIS_RADIUS        = ER
          B_AXIS_RADIUS        = ER
          C_AXIS_RADIUS        = ER
          FLATTENING           = (ER - PR)/ER
 
    REVPER-PLANET
   	Derived from data from The 1989 Astronomical Almanac as
   	360/n where n is the Daily Motion from page E3.
 
    ROTATION-PLANET
   	The 1989 Astronomical Almanac, page E87.
   	The Astronomical Almanac, 1989, page C3.
 
    SURFGRAV-PLANET
   	Derived from data in THE 1989 ASTRONOMICAL ALMANAC and the
   	1988 REPORT OF THE IAU WORKING GROUP ON CARTOGRAPHIC
   	COORDINATES as (G * MASS)/(MR * MR) where MR is MEAN RADIUS
   	from this catalog, MASS comes from page E88, and the
   	gravitational constant, G, comes from page K6.]]></field>
