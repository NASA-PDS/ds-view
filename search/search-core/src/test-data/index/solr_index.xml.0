<field name="data_set_description"><![CDATA[Data Set Overview
  =================
    The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Electron Reflectometer Angular Data
    (ERAD) consist of time-ordered series of 100-600-eV electron flux
    measurements for 16 look directions spanning a 360 x 14 degree field
    of view.  These data are intended to supplement existing MGS ER
    data, which cover the entire instrumental energy range (10 eV -
    20 keV), but are omni-directional.
 
    Separate data files are provided for each of four energy channels,
    116, 191, 314, and 515 eV (dE/E = 25%).  These energies were chosen
    because:
 
        1) Electron trajectories are not significantly bent by the
           spacecraft floating potential at energies > 100 eV.
 
        2) Count rates at energies < 600 eV are typically > 100 times
           greater than instrument background.
 
        3) Sunlight contamination can be safely neglected in this
           energy range, except when sunlight directly enters the
           instrument aperture, which rarely occurs in the mapping
           configuration.
 
    Each record consists of a time tag (UTC, spacecraft event time) with
    16 scalars representing measurements of electron energy flux in 16
    look directions, 16 scalars indicating the uncertainties in those
    measurements, 1 scalar indicating instrument background, 2 scalars
    for the magnetic field azimuth and elevation angles in sensor
    coordinates, and 1 scalar indicating the size of the angular
    uncertainty cone around the magnetic field direction.  Electron
    fluxes, uncertainties, and background are in units of electron
    differential energy flux, eV/(cm^2 sec ster eV).  Angles are in
    degrees.
 
    The Electron Reflectometer field of view is a 360 x 14 degree fan
    that is divided into sixteen 22.5 x 14 degree sectors, numbered
    0 through 15, each with its own counter.  The ER is mounted on the
    nadir deck of the spacecraft.  Its orientation is shown in the
    MGS ER mounting description currently located in the DOCUMENT
    directory of the PDS volume containing these data.  ER azimuth is
    defined in the ER X-Y plane with zero at the boundary between
    sectors 0 and 15.  Note that ER coordinates are left handed,
    so that azimuth increases with sector number.  ER elevation is
    measured out of the ER X-Y plane.  The field of view extends to
    +/- 7 degrees elevation.
 
    During the Mapping Phase, as the spacecraft orbits the planet, the
    ER field of view sweeps out the entire sky (4-pi ster) every 58.5
    minutes, which is much longer than the integration time per record
    (2-8 sec, depending on telemetry rate) and much longer than most
    timescales of interest in Mars' plasma environment.  Thus, the
    field of view for each data record spans ~12% of the sky.  However,
    since electrons are constrained to travel along magnetic field
    lines, it is more important to consider an electron's motion with
    respect to the magnetic field.
 
    In a uniform field, electrons gyrate around magnetic field lines on
    helical paths of constant radius (typically a few km) and pitch
    angle, which is the angle between an electron's velocity and the
    magnetic field.  With knowledge of the ambient magnetic field
    direction measured by the MGS Magnetometer (MAG), the ER field of
    view can be mapped into pitch angle.  In the ER X-Y plane, the
    relationship between azimuth (az) and pitch angle is:
 
 
        cos(Pitch Angle) = cos(az - Baz) * cos(Bel)
 
 
    where Baz and Bel are the azimuth and elevation of the magnetic field
    in ER sensor coordinates.  When Bel = 0, the ER measures the entire
    pitch angle distribution (0-180 degrees) twice, once for each half of
    the field of view.  When Bel = 90 degrees, the ER measures only pitch
    angles of 90 degrees.  All values of Bel are possible, but the ER
    field of view is oriented in such a way that when the magnetic field
    has a large radial component (with respect to the planet), Bel is
    small, and most of the pitch angle distribution is observed.  The
    magnetic field tends to have a large radial component on the night
    hemisphere and in the vicinity of crustal magnetic fields.
 
    ER Angular Data is intended to be used in conjunction with ER omni-
    directional data, MAG data, and spacecraft ephemeris data.  Time tags
    are provided to synchronize the ERAD with all of these data sets.
    The electron energy distribution (omni-directional data) contains
    information about the plasma environment (i.e., whether the
    spacecraft is in the magnetosheath, magnetotail, or ionosphere).  The
    MAG data provide the strength and direction of the local magnetic
    field (from crustal sources or induced by the Mars-solar wind
    interaction).  The ERAD provide information about the large-scale
    configuration of the magnetic field -- for example, whether the
    spacecraft is on a closed crustal magnetic field loop, on an open
    crustal field line connected to the solar wind, or on a solar wind
    field line.  Electron reflectometry can be used on open field lines
    to determine the magnetic field strength at altitudes near the
    exobase (~180 km) and to probe the atmospheric density between the
    spacecraft and the exobase.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
    Each Mars Global Surveyor ER angle data file contains a time ordered
    series of electron differential energy flux measurements at a given
    energy (ranging from 100-600 eV).  ER data are organized into
    ''packets'', each of which contains 12, 24, or 48 seconds of data, for
    high, medium, and low spacecraft telemetry rates, respectively.  Each
    packet is further subdivided into samples.  There are 6 samples per
    packet for each of the relevant energy channels, as displayed in the
    table below, resulting in sample periods of 2, 4, or 8 seconds,
    depending on telemetry rate.  The time listed for each record is the
    center of the sampling interval.
 
    The relevant energy channels and sampling intervals are as follows:
 
 
        Channel Number        Energy Range     Samples per Packet
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
               7              415 - 639   eV           6
               8              253 - 390   eV           6
               9              153 - 237   eV           6
              10               92 - 144   eV           6
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
    In-flight calibrations are available for each of the pre-mapping
    mission phases (AB1, SPO1, SPO2, and AB2), and are performed about
    once per month in the Mapping and Extended phases.  This calibration
    is used to determine the relative instrumental sensitivity around
    the FOV to an accuracy of 5-10%.  The sensitivity varies slowly
    with time primarily because of aging of the microchannel plate (MCP),
    which is used to amplify the signal from a single electron into an
    electrical pulse that can be detected on the anode.  This information
    is taken into account when converting count rates to calibrated
    electron differential energy fluxes.
 
    The local magnetic field measured by the Magnetometer is rotated
    into ER sensor coordinates (see the MGS ER mounting description
    mentioned above) to determine the pitch angle range spanned by each
    angular sector of the instrument.  The magnetic field direction
    changes continuously, so the pitch angle map must be determined
    separately for every data record.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    Processing is carried out at the Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) of
    the University of California, Berkeley, (UCB) to convert the raw data
    to measurements of the electron energy flux eV/(cm^2 s ster eV).
    Because of the instrument's high dynamic range (six decades), the
    onboard digital processing unit (DPU) compresses the raw counts in a
    logarithmic scale. The first step is to decompress the raw counts and
    construct a three-dimensional data array, where the first dimension
    is time (6 elements per telemetry packet), the second dimension is
    direction around the FOV (16 elements), and the third dimension is
    energy (4 elements).
 
    The data array is converted from raw counts to differential energy
    flux as follows.  Raw count rate (R) is obtained by dividing the raw
    counts by the integration time (0.0625 sec per energy step).  The
    data are next corrected for deadtime.  During the time it takes the
    instrument to process a single electron (known as the ''deadtime'',
    which is about 0.5 microsec for the ER), it ignores any other
    electrons.  The raw count rate is multiplied by the factor 1/(1 -
    RT), where T is the deadtime, to obtain corrected count rate.  Data
    values are masked (set to -9.999e-9) when the deadtime correction
    factor exceeds 1.25.
 
    These data are NOT CORRECTED for instrumental background, which is
    caused primarily by high energy particles that penetrate the
    ~2-mm-thick instrument casing and impact the MCP.  Electrons > few
    MeV and protons > 20 MeV have sufficient energy to do this. (Lower
    energy particles are also detected if any of the secondaries they
    produce reach the detector.)  Since these particles bypass the
    electostatic analyzer section, they produce a count rate that is
    independent of the instrument's energy sweep, typically dominating
    the signal in the highest 2-3 energy channels.  During quiet times,
    the background count rate over the entire anode is 7-10 counts/sec,
    which translates to 350-500 eV/(cm^2 s ster eV) in the ERAD.  Most of
    the time, the signal in the highest energy channel (13-20 keV) is
    dominated by background.  Exceptions to this sometimes occur during
    bowshock or interplanetary shock crossings (when significant fluxes
    of >10 keV electrons are present) or during energetic solar events,
    when bursts of solar energetic particles can increase the flux of
    penetrating particles by several orders of magnitude.  Assuming that
    the highest energy channel contains 100% background, the background
    level for the lower energy channels used in this data set can be
    estimated as B(E) = B(20 keV), where B(E) is the background level (in
    units of eV cm-2 s-1 ster-1 eV-1) at energy E.  The background is
    typically negligible at energies below about 1 keV.  Finally, we divide
    by the geometric factor (0.02 cm2 ster) to obtain the differential
    energy flux eV/(cm^2 s ster eV).
 
    In order for the user to calculate pitch angles for each sector and
    observation, the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to
    the ER instrument must be supplied.  To accomplish this, the magnetic
    field vectors recorded by MGS MAG, expressed in a payload coordinate
    system, are first resampled to the time resolution of the electron
    observations.  Then, the orientation of the local field vector in
    azimuth and elevation are recorded, along with an uncertainty.  The
    ER sectors are numbered 0-15 in a clockwise fashion as viewed from
    above the ER instrument.  Azimuth is defined from 0-360 degrees, also
    in a clockwise fashion as viewed from above ER, with 0 degrees
    located at the boundary between instrument sectors 0 and 15.
    Elevation is defined between -90 and 90 degrees, with 90 degrees
    indicating the local magnetic field is orthogonal to the instrument
    aperture and pointed ''up'' away from the instrument (in the +z
    direction for the left-handed coordinate system defined by the azimuth
    angles), 90 degrees pointing ''down'' toward the instrument, and 0
    degrees indicating that the local magnetic field is in the plane of
    the instrument aperture. The uncertainty in the local magnetic field
    vector is supplied as a single angle defining a cone around the
    nominal vector.  Therefore, the uncertainty for a given observation
    could be in the azimuth direction or the elevation direction or (most
    likely) both.
 
    Finally, data for sectors 9 and 10 are supplied as for all other
    sectors in this data set.  However, in-flight intercalibration
    indicates that sectors 9 and 10 have significantly higher
    uncertainties than the other sectors.  Therefore we recommend that
    sectors 9 and 10 be disregarded in any science analysis using these
    data.
 
    After processing, data are written to ASCII tables, described below.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    The ERDR data set consists of four time-ordered tables containing
    electron fluxes in each of four different instrument energy ranges as
    a function of instrument sector.  Each table contains 43 columns, as
    follows:
 
     COLUMN       CONTAINS
     ------       ----------------------------------------------------
      1-6         time stamp (yr, day of year, hr, min, sec, msec)
      7-22        electron energy fluxes for 16 ER sectors
      23-38       one-sigma error estimates for 16 ER sectors
      39          estimate of instrument background (energy flux units)
      40-41       azimuth and elevation of local B-field wrt ER
      42          angular uncertainty in local B-field direction
 
 
    (Note:  The column numbering given here differs from the column
    numbering in the PDS labels for these data.  This is not a real
    discrepancy; it reflects the fact that the PDS labels treat the
    time stamp as a single multi-part column.)
 
    File names in this data set currently follow the format
 
    MyyDddd_PAD_eee.STS
 
    where yy = 2-digit year, ddd = 3-digit day of year, and eee =
    3-digit energy channel in eV as described under ''Data Set Overview''
    above.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    No additional ancillary data is required for use of these data.
    However, the user may wish to use MAG data and MGS spacecraft
    ephemeris information in conjunction with this dataset, also
    available from the PDS.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    The data are presented in a coordinate system tied to the ER
    instrument. Each of the 16 energy fluxes and error bars are
    associated with a single angular sector of the instrument.  Azimuth
    and elevation angles necessary to compute pitch angles for each
    sector are supplied with respect to the instrument, as described in
    the sections above.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    No software is provided with this PDS data set.
 
    Data reduction software for the ERAD is written in IDL.
 
    Users are advised that the following line of pseudocode can be used
    to compute the pitch angle range spanned by each of the ER's 16
    angular sectors, given the azimuth (Baz) and elevation (Bel) of the
    ambient magnetic field in sensor coordinates:
 
 
               cos(pitch angle) = cos(az - Baz) * cos(Bel)
 
 
    where az represents the azimuth range spanned by one of the sectors.
    For example, to compute the pitch angle range spanned by Sector 0,
    one would use a range of 0-22.5 degrees for az, together with values
    of Baz and Bel in sensor coordinates provided for each data record.
    Note that Baz and Bel vary continuously, so a separate pitch angle
    map must be computed for each data record.  Also note that the
    maximum and minimum pitch angles sampled by a given sector need not
    be at the edges of the sector.  One way to present these data on a
    plot of energy flux (Y axis) vs. pitch angle (X axis), is to plot
    horizontal ''error bars'' representing the pitch angles spanned by
    each sector and vertical error bars for the one-sigma flux
    uncertainties.

<field name="confidence_level_note"><![CDATA[Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The ER instrument design is typically used on a rapidly spinning
    spacecraft (few seconds period), on which the disk-shaped FOV would
    sweep out the entire sky in a time that is short compared with most
    timescales of interest.  However, since MGS spins slowly (once per
    orbit), each data record covers only a small region of the sky.
    Any application of these data that requires an unbiased average over
    all look directions (4-pi ster) is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead, use
    the formula above for calculating a separate pitch angle map for
    each data record.  Complete (0-180 degrees) pitch angle coverage is
    rarely achieved, but the pitch angle coverage is often sufficient to
    determine magnetic field topology and to detect loss cones caused by
    atmospheric absorption of electrons.
 
    The ER is mounted on the spacecraft body, where measurements are
    susceptible to the following effects:
 
    1. Spacecraft charging: The spacecraft typically charges to several
       volts positive in sunlight and several tens of volts negative in
       shadow.  Since electrons have to cross this potential before
       reaching the ER aperture, the energy scale of the ER is effectively
       shifted by the amount of the spacecraft potential.  In addition,
       it is possible for different parts of the spacecraft to charge
       to different potentials, because of differences in material
       properties.  Differential charging sets up small-scale electric
       fields that can bend the trajectories of low energy electrons.
       At the >100 eV energies used in this data set, these effects are
       relatively small and can be safely neglected.  For increased
       confidence, the user may compare pitch angle distributions at
       100 and 500 eV.
 
    2. Spacecraft photoelectrons: Parts of the spacecraft that are
       illuminated by the sun will emit photoelectrons.  Most of these
       spacecraft photoelectrons have energies below ~10 eV, but a
       small part of the distribution extends up to ~60 eV.  Since
       parts of the spacecraft are close to the ER field of view, some
       of these spacecraft photoelectrons can enter the ER aperture
       and contaminate the measurements.  The flux and angular
       distribution of spacecraft photoelectrons as seen by the ER
       depends on the illumination pattern of the spacecraft.  At the
       >100 eV energies of this data set, spacecraft photoelectron
       contamination can be safely neglected.
 
    3. Field-of-view blockage:  Parts of the field of view are partially
       obstructed by the spacecraft.  In the mapping configuration (with
       the high gain antenna deployed) these obstructions include the -Y
       solar array gimbal and corners of the spacecraft bus.  To first
       order, these fixed obstructions are accounted for in the
       calibration of the ER field of view.  (Sectors that contain an
       obstruction are assigned a lower effective sensitivity.)
 
    4. Solar energetic particle (SEP) events:  The instrument background
       is dominated by penetrating particles due to galactic cosmic rays
       (GCRs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs), which are produced
       during solar flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
       The GCR background is negligible in the 100-500 eV energy range --
       the fluxes of ambient electrons dominate by several orders of
       magnitude.  However, during large solar events (''space weather''),
       SEPs can increase the background level enough to be significant
       even in the 100-500 eV range.  The user is cautioned to use the
       background data provided in this data set to identify SEP events.
       Large events may prevent the reliable use of these data.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    The ERAD will be reviewed internally by the MGS MAG/ER team prior to
    release to the planetary community. The ERAD will also be reviewed
    by the PDS.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    ER data are recorded continuously.  Data coverage depends almost
    entirely on the fraction of the spacecraft telemetry that can be
    received by the DSN.  The mapping orbit lies close to the ionopause
    altitude.  Because of spatial and temporal variations in the
    ionopause, the ER can sample several different plasma environments,
    including the ionosphere, the magnetosheath, the magnetotail, and
    closed magnetic field lines anchored to remanent crustal sources.
    Data quality is best when the spacecraft is within the planet's
    shadow.  In sunlight, data quality is a function of spacecraft
    rotation phase, since photoelectron contamination depends on the
    illumination pattern.  Additionally, pitch angle coverage is
    controlled by a combination of ER look direction and the local
    magnetic field direction. In some instances it is possible that the
    local magnetic field is orthogonal to the ER field of view, so that
    the pitch angle coverage is limited to a small range around 90 deg.
    However, a much more typical situation is partial pitch angle
    coverage, which is often sufficient to establish the topology of
    the magnetic field and to identify loss cones caused by atmospheric
    absorption of electrons.  The ER field of view is oriented in such
    a way that the pitch angle coverage is best whenever there is a
    large radial component (with respect to the planet) of the ambient
    magnetic field.  This situation often occurs on the night hemisphere
    (because of the draped magnetotail) and over strong crustal magnetic
    fields.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    The ER is mounted on the spacecraft instrument deck and has a
    disk-shaped FOV that is orthogonal to the spacecraft XY plane and
    nearly orthogonal to the spacecraft Y axis.  (There is a 10-degree
    rotation about the Z axis to minimize spacecraft obstructions in the
    FOV.)  This 360-degree FOV is divided into 16 angular sectors, each
    22.5 degrees wide.  Throughout mapping, the ER is in
    ''fixed-sector'' mode, meaning that these 16 angular sectors
    remained constant in the spacecraft reference frame, sweeping out
    the entire sky every 1/2 of an orbit.
 
    Parts of the spacecraft are within the instrument's FOV.  The high
    gain antenna (HGA), which blocked ~70 degrees of the FOV during
    aerobraking is not in the FOV during mapping.  Smaller amounts of
    blockage are caused by attitude control thrusters and the -Y solar
    array gimbal and yoke assembly.  One effect this has on the
    measurements is to block ambient electrons from the directions of
    the obstacles. This is most clearly seen at high energies (> 100
    eV), which are only slightly deflected by the spacecraft floating
    potential.  In addition, when these obstacles are illuminated by the
    sun, they emit photoelectrons up to ~50 eV, which can enter the ER
    aperture and elevate the counting rate at low energies.  The
    detailed signature of this effect depends on the illumination
    pattern as the spacecraft rotates, which is a function of the angles
    between Earth, Mars, and the Sun.  These angles varied throughout
    the mapping phase. Photoelectron contamination has not been removed
    from the data; however, observations that were likely to have been
    contaminated have not been included in this dataset.  The presence of
    contamination is readily identified in the low energy channels (< 50
    eV) by a sharp (nearly discontinuous) increase in counting rate which
    appears at regular 100-minute intervals.  The contamination
    disappears as abruptly as it appears.
 
    For a duration of ~4 minutes every 1/2 spacecraft spin (when the
    spacecraft is illuminated) sunlight can directly enter the ER
    aperture and scatter inside the instrument, creating secondary
    electrons.  (Note: the spacecraft spins once per orbit to keep the
    nadir deck pointed at the planet.)  A tiny fraction of these photons
    and secondary electrons can scatter down to the anode and create a
    ''pulse'' of spurious counts.  This sunlight pulse appears at all
    energies, but is most noticeable from 10 to 80 eV and above 1 keV,
    outside the range of energies included with this dataset.  Sunlight
    pulses, therefore, have not been removed from the data.
 
    The instrument's energy scale is referenced to spacecraft ground.
    In sunlight, spacecraft ground floats a few volts positive relative
    to the plasma in which the spacecraft is immersed.  Electrons are
    accelerated by the spacecraft potential before they can enter the ER
    aperture, thus all energies are shifted upward by a few eV.  In
    addition to shifting the electron energy, the trajectories of low
    energy electrons can be significantly bent by electric fields around
    the spacecraft.  Thus, the energy scale and imaging characteristics
    are relatively poor at the lowest energies (10-30 eV), becoming much
    more accurate at the higher energies used in this dataset.]]></field>

  ===================
    The Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) is part of the Athena
    payload of the two Mars Exploration Rovers (MER). The APXS sensor
    head is attached to the turret of the Instrument Deployment Device
    (IDD) of the rover. The APXS is a very light-weight instrument for
    determining the major and minor elemental composition of Martian
    soils, rocks, and other geological materials at the MER landing
    sites. The sensor head has simply to be docked by the IDD on the
    surface of the selected sample. X-ray radiation, excited by alpha
    particles and x-rays of the radioactive sources, is recorded by a
    high-resolution x-ray detector. The x-ray spectra show elements
    starting from sodium up to yttrium depending on their
    concentrations. The backscattered alpha spectra, measured by a ring
    of detectors, provide additional data on carbon and oxygen. By means
    of a proper calibration, the elemental concentrations are derived.
    Together with data from the two other Athena instruments mounted on
    the IDD, the samples under investigation can be fully characterized.
    Key APXS objectives are the determination of the chemistry of
    crustal rocks and soils and the examination of water-related
    deposits, sediments, or evaporates. Using the rock abrasion tool
    (RAT) attached to the IDD, issues of weathering can be addressed by
    measuring natural and abraded surfaces of rocks.
 
    Information in this instrument description is taken from The New
    Athena Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) for the Mars
    Exploration Rovers mission paper [RIEDERETAL2003]. See this paper
    for more details.
 
 
  Scientific Objectives
  =====================
    The chief scientific objective of the APXS is:
 
    1) to determine the major and minor elemental composition of Martian
    soils, rocks, and other geological materials at the MER landing
    sites
 
 
  Calibration
  ===========
    During the calibration campaign in the Max Plank Institute Mainz
    laboratory many geostandards were measured. These standards are
    powdered geological samples, whose elemental concentrations are
    certified by qualified institutions. The two flight instruments
    containing their flight sources were calibrated using 11
    validated samples (8 geostandards and 3 meteorites) and a set of
    oxide and metal standards.
 
    A check of the performance of the instrument after the landing on
    Mars will be done making use of the internal calibration target on
    the doors and the Compositional Calibration Target (CCT) that is
    mounted on the rover chassis in reach of the IDD. The x-ray spectrum
    of the internal calibration target shows gold, nickel, and copper
    lines. The target consists of a set of thin layers of gold, Kapton
    (carbon), and nickel on top of the copper-beryllium body of the
    doors. Energy calibration, FWHM, and linearity can be checked by
    evaluation of the copper and gold lines and comparison with
    pre-launch data.
 
    Contamination of the beryllium entrance window of the x-ray
    detector will be noticeable by an intensity reduction of the
    low-energy M lines of gold compared to the L lines. Energy
    calibration can be checked with the position of the gold peak (a
    peak and not a step because of the small thickness of the Au layer).
    The carbon step provides an additional check of consistency.
 
    The CCT consists of a magnetite plate. This target was designed
    for the needs of the MB, but, it can also be used by the APXS to
    check its FWHM usually determined for the 6.4-keV line of iron.
    As the target is mounted on the outside of the rover, it will
    eventually be covered with dust, but the line shape of the Fe
    line will not be affected.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    There are a few considerations that must be taken into account
    to acquire the best data possible:
 
    1) To search for trace elements, two to four hours are
       sufficient for the x-ray mode. The search for carbon requires
       at least eight hours for the alpha mode as the alpha sensitivity
       is low. X-ray and alpha mode always operate together.
 
    2) To properly make an APXS measurement, the sensor head has to
       be correctly 'docked' at the selected sample by the IDD. The
       nominal APXS docking procedure is the following:
 
      Use images taken by the rover's front cameras: Navcams
      (navigation cameras) and/or Hazcams (hazard avoidance cameras)
      to calculate the IDD positioning
 
      Open the doors by pressing the APXS contact ring against the
      CCT or any other solid surface of the rover
 
      Position the APXS contact ring up against a selected sample
      area with a positional accuracy of 10 mm and 10 degrees on a
      target not previously contacted, or 4 mm and 3 degrees for a
      target previously contacted by any one of the IDD instruments
 
      After data acquisition, the APXS doors are closed by rotating
      the turret past a roller until the release lever is actuated
 
    3) For touch-and-go operations, optimum resolution for the x-ray
       detector is obtained at temperatures of 248 K, and the shortest
       measurement time should be at least 15 minutes
 
 
  Detectors
  =========
    The sensor head is packaged in a cylindrical enclosure 53 mm in
    diameter and 84 mm in length and terminates in an insulating flange
    of 68 mm x 68 mm. The front part facing the sample contains the
    xray detector, mounted on the axis of the instrument, a cylindrical
    source holder with six alpha sources, and six rectangular alpha
    detectors. The coaxial arrangement of sources and detectors for
    alpha particles and x-rays assures that both detectors 'see' the
    same intensity distribution across the sample.
 
    Use of a high resolution x-ray detector (silicon drift detector with
    10 mm^2 active area, a 5 micron thick Be-window and an energy
    resolution of about 160 eV @ 5.9 keV) permits high quality
    measurements. The advanced detector versions were provided by KETEK,
    Munich, Germany.
 
    There is a second group of detectors, identical to the alpha
    detectors, but not exposed to alpha particles from the sample.These
    detectors measure the background contribution to alpha spectra due
    to cosmic radiation at the surface of Mars and high energy gamma
    background of the Cm sources as well as the Moessbauer source. The
    field of view for the x rays is delineated by means of a collimator
    in front of the detector: the collimator is formed by two apertures
    made from Zr, one immediately in front of the detector and one in
    the central orifice of the source holder.
 
    The alpha sources (6 pellets) are contained in a source holder that
    attaches to the sensor head with a spring loaded bayonet-style
    mechanism. This permits quick and easy exchange of the sources
    without the need to disassemble the sensor head. The sources are
    covered with 2.5 micron thick titanium foils, turning them into
    'quasi-closed' sources (hermetically sealed sources are under
    development, but were not available for this mission). The foils
    prevent contamination of samples with source material, emitted from
    the sources as a result of 'recoil sputtering', and the same time
    reduce the energy of the alpha particles from 5.80 MeV to 5.17 MeV,
    thereby avoiding a resonance in the 12C(alpha, alpha')12C reaction
    at ca. 5.7 MeV (Figure 6). This measure, together with an optimized
    design of the source-collimator-detector geometry, significantly
    reduces the background signals from carbon and oxygen in the Martian
    CO2-atmosphere. Nevertheless, this background signal remains the
    limiting factor for the determination of carbon in the samples.
 
 
  Electronics
  ===========
    The main electronics consists of the analog signal conditioning
    segments (6-pole Gaussian filter amplifiers, threshold
    discriminators and peak detectors), an analog multiplexer, a 16-bit
    analog-to-digital converter and an 8-bit microcontroller.
 
    Control logic determines the presence of a relevant signal and
    generates an interrupt in the microcontroller. To avoid additional
    noise in the analog signal chain, the microcontroller is kept in
    idle mode until the analog signal is processed and buffered in the
    peak detectors. Selection of the appropriate multiplexer input,
    conversion of the signal amplitude to a digital number and
    registration of the signal by incrementing the number of counts in
    the corresponding amplitude channel of the respective detector is
    then handled by the microcontroller. Conversion time is typically
    200 microseconds. A digital temperature compensation routine that
    minimizes the influence of temperature changes during long
    measurements adds another 100 microseconds. For a mean count rate
    of 100 Hz, a total dead time of below 5 % is achieved.
 
    The microcontroller is equipped with a watchdog circuit that
    performs a soft reset in case of an abnormal program flow. The data
    are stored in 32 Kbyte SRAM that are buffered by a battery located
    on the main electronics board.
 
    The interface for commanding the instrument and transfer of data
    consists of an RS 422 serial link. Power is provided to the
    instrument directly from the board battery (nominally 28 V);
    voltages required by the electronics (5 V digital, +/-5 V analog
    and +/-12 V analog) are generated by its own power converter and
    filters.
 
    The x-ray spectrum is divided into 512 channels. The lower threshold
    is fixed at ~850 eV. This is sufficient to detect Na at 1040 eV. The
    upper energy limit is about 16 keV. The spectral range includes the
    K lines up to Zr and the L and M lines of higher Z elements. It also
    contains elastic scattered Pu lines at 14.3 keV and 12.6 keV, as
    well as inelastic scattered peaks. The alpha and background spectra
    use 256 channels and range up to about 6 MeV.

<field name="investigation_description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
 
    Mariner 10 was the seventh successful launch in the Mariner series
    and the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull of one planet
    (Venus) to reach another (Mercury). The spacecraft flew by Mercury
    three times in a heliocentric orbit and returned images and data on
    the planet. Mariner 10 is the only spacecraft to have visited
    Mercury.
 
    Spacecraft and Subsystems
 
    The spacecraft structure was an eight-sided framework with eight
    electronics compartments. It measured 1.39 m diagonally and 0.457 m
    in depth. Two solar panels, each 2.7 m long and 0.97 m wide, were
    attached at the top, supporting 5.1 sq m of solar cell area. The
    rocket engine was liquid-fueled, with two sets of reaction jets used
    to stabilize the spacecraft on three axes. It carried a low-gain
    omnidirectional antenna, composed of a honeycomb-disk parabolic
    reflector, 1.37 m in diameter, with focal length 55 cm. Feeds
    enabled the spacecraft to transmit at S- and X-band frequencies. The
    spacecraft carried a Canopus star tracker, located on the upper ring
    structure of the octagonal satellite, and acquisition sun sensors on
    the tips of the solar panels. The interior of the spacecraft was
    insulated with multiplayer thermal blankets at top and bottom. A
    sunshade was deployed after launch to protect the spacecraft on the
    solar-oriented side.
 
    Instruments on-board the spacecraft measured the atmospheric,
    surface, and physical characteristics of Mercury and Venus.
    Experiments included television photography, magnetic field, plasma,
    infrared radiometry, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and radio science
    detectors. An experimental X-band, high-frequency transmitter was
    flown for the first time on this spacecraft.
 
    Mission Profile
 
    Mariner 10 was placed in a parking orbit after launch for
    approximately 25 minutes, then placed in orbit around the Sun en
    route to Venus. The orbit direction was opposite to the motion of
    the Earth around the Sun. Mid-course corrections were made. The
    spacecraft passed Venus on February 5, 1974, at a distance of 4200
    km. It crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974, at 2046 UT,
    at a distance of about 703 km from the surface. The TV and UV
    experiments were turned on the comet Kohoutek while the spacecraft
    was on the way to Venus. A second encounter with Mercury, when more
    photographs were taken, occurred on September 21, 1974, at an
    altitude of about 47,000 km. A third and last Mercury encounter at
    an altitude of 327 km, with additional photography of about 300
    photographs and magnetic field measurements occurred on March 16,
    1975. Engineering tests were continued until March 24, 1975, when
    the supply of attitude-control gas was depleted and the mission was
    terminated.
 
    Total research, deployment, launch, and support costs for the
    Mariner series of spacecraft (Mariners 1 through 10) was
    approximately $554 million.

<field name="description"><![CDATA[Mission Overview
  ================
 
    Mariner 10 was the seventh successful launch in the Mariner series
    and the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull of one planet
    (Venus) to reach another (Mercury). The spacecraft flew by Mercury
    three times in a heliocentric orbit and returned images and data on
    the planet. Mariner 10 is the only spacecraft to have visited
    Mercury.
 
    Spacecraft and Subsystems
 
    The spacecraft structure was an eight-sided framework with eight
    electronics compartments. It measured 1.39 m diagonally and 0.457 m
    in depth. Two solar panels, each 2.7 m long and 0.97 m wide, were
    attached at the top, supporting 5.1 sq m of solar cell area. The
    rocket engine was liquid-fueled, with two sets of reaction jets used
    to stabilize the spacecraft on three axes. It carried a low-gain
    omnidirectional antenna, composed of a honeycomb-disk parabolic
    reflector, 1.37 m in diameter, with focal length 55 cm. Feeds
    enabled the spacecraft to transmit at S- and X-band frequencies. The
    spacecraft carried a Canopus star tracker, located on the upper ring
    structure of the octagonal satellite, and acquisition sun sensors on
    the tips of the solar panels. The interior of the spacecraft was
    insulated with multiplayer thermal blankets at top and bottom. A
    sunshade was deployed after launch to protect the spacecraft on the
    solar-oriented side.
 
    Instruments on-board the spacecraft measured the atmospheric,
    surface, and physical characteristics of Mercury and Venus.
    Experiments included television photography, magnetic field, plasma,
    infrared radiometry, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and radio science
    detectors. An experimental X-band, high-frequency transmitter was
    flown for the first time on this spacecraft.
 
    Mission Profile
 
    Mariner 10 was placed in a parking orbit after launch for
    approximately 25 minutes, then placed in orbit around the Sun en
    route to Venus. The orbit direction was opposite to the motion of
    the Earth around the Sun. Mid-course corrections were made. The
    spacecraft passed Venus on February 5, 1974, at a distance of 4200
    km. It crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974, at 2046 UT,
    at a distance of about 703 km from the surface. The TV and UV
    experiments were turned on the comet Kohoutek while the spacecraft
    was on the way to Venus. A second encounter with Mercury, when more
    photographs were taken, occurred on September 21, 1974, at an
    altitude of about 47,000 km. A third and last Mercury encounter at
    an altitude of 327 km, with additional photography of about 300
    photographs and magnetic field measurements occurred on March 16,
    1975. Engineering tests were continued until March 24, 1975, when
    the supply of attitude-control gas was depleted and the mission was
    terminated.
 
    Total research, deployment, launch, and support costs for the
    Mariner series of spacecraft (Mariners 1 through 10) was
    approximately $554 million.
