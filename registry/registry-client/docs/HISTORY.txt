Changelog
=========

What follows is a history of changes from release to release, along with
issues addressed and new features in each release.


0.0.0 - Unreleased
------------------

There are no releases yet of the PDS Registry Client.  However, this release
does include the following changes from the original unreleased release:

* The client now works with 0.8.0-dev of the Registry Service.
* Support for the ``versionID`` attribute in the RegistryObject class is
  dropped as the Registry Service no longer makes that a "user-visible"
  attribute.
