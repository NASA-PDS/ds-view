What follows is a history of changes from release to release, along with
issues addressed and new features in each release.


1.0.0 - Released
------------------

This release includes the following changes from the original 
unreleased release:

* The client now works with 1.0.0 of the Registry Service.
* Support for the ``versionID`` attribute in the RegistryObject class is
  dropped as the Registry Service no longer makes that a "user-visible"
  attribute.
