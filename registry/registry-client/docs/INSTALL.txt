Requirements
============

Python 2.6.


Installation
============

By far, the easiest way to install pds.registry is to use pip_ or
easy_install_.  As a privileged user, type::

    pip install pds.registry

or::

    easy_install pds.registry

The software as well as its dependencies will be downloaded and installed
automatically.


Installing from Source
----------------------

If neither pip nor easy_install are available on your system, just install
from source:

1.  Download the source package archive.
2.  Extract the gzip'd tar archive.
3.  In the extracted directory, run ``python setup.py install`` as a
    privileged user.
