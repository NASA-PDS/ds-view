    <section name="List Extrinsics">
      <p>This software queries a registry service instance for a list of extrinsics. This software does have a dependency on the <i>pds.registry</i> package which must be deployed to the local Python environment prior to operation of this software. The List Extrinsics software consists of one Python script:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>list-extrinsics.py<br/>This script queries a registry service instance for a list of extrinsics filtered by Object Type and LID wildcard. The extrinsics are listed in CSV format to standard out with fields: lid, version_id, name and status.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The script referenced above can be found in the <i>bin/list-extrinsics</i> directory.
